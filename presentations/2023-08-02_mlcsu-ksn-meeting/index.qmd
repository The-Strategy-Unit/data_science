## What is data science?

* "A data scientist knows more about computer science than the average statistician, and more about statistics than the average computer scientist"

[(Josh Wills, a former head of data engineering at Slack)](https://medium.com/odscjournal/data-scientists-versus-statisticians-8ea146b7a47f)

## What are the skills of data science?

* Analysis
  * ML
  * Stats
  * Data viz
* Software engineering
  * Programming
  * SQL/ data
  * DevOps
  * RAP

## What are the skills of data science?
  
* Domain knowledge
  * Communication
  * Problem formulation
  * Dashboards and reports

## Stats and data viz

* ML leans a bit more towards atheoretical prediction
* Stats leans a bit more towards inference (but they both do both)
* Data scientists may use different visualisations
  * Interactive web based tools
  * Dashboard based visualisers e.g. [{stminsights}](https://github.com/cschwem2er/stminsights)
  
## Software engineering

* Programming
  * No/ low code data science?
* SQL/ data
  * Tend to use reproducible automated processes
* DevOps
  * Plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor
* RAP
  * I will come back to this

## Domain knowledge

* Do stuff that matters
  * The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks. [Jeffrey Hammerbacher](https://www.fastcompany.com/3008436/why-data-god-jeffrey-hammerbacher-left-facebook-found-cloudera)
* Convince other people that it matters
* This is the hardest part of data science

## RAP

* Data science isn't RAP
* RAP isn't data science
* They are firm friends

## Reproducibility

* Reproducibility in science
* The [$6B spreadsheet error](https://baselinescenario.com/2013/02/09/the-importance-of-excel/)
* [George Osbourne's austerity was based on a spreadsheet error](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity)
* For us, reproducibility also means we can do the same analysis 50 times in one minute
  * Which is why I started down the road of data science
  
## What is RAP

* a process in which code is used to minimise manual, undocumented steps, and a clear, properly documented process is produced in code which can reliably give the same result from the same dataset
* RAP should be:

> the core working practice that must be supported by all platforms and teams; make this a core focus of NHS analyst training

:::

## Levels of RAP- Baseline

* Data produced by code in an open-source language (e.g., Python, R, SQL)
* Code is version controlled
* Repository includes a README.md file that clearly details steps a user must follow to reproduce the code
* Code has been peer reviewed
* Code is published in the open and linked to & from accompanying publication (if relevant)

:::

## Levels of RAP- Silver

* Code is well-documented...
* Code is well-organised following standard directory format
* Reusable functions and/or classes are used where appropriate
* Pipeline includes a testing framework
* Repository includes dependency information (e.g. requirements.txt, PipFile, environment.yml)
* Data is handled and output in a [Tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format

:::

## Levels of RAP- Gold

* Code is fully packaged
* Repository automatically runs tests etc. via CI/CD or a different integration/deployment tool e.g. GitHub Actions
* Process runs based on event-based triggers (e.g., new data in database) or on a schedule
* Changes to the RAP are clearly signposted. E.g. a changelog in the package, releases etc. (See gov.uk info on Semantic Versioning)
