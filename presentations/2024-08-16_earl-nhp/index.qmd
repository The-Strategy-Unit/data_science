## The New Hospital Programme (NHP)

::: {.notes}
TODO: Merge PR from Chris
:::

- Manifesto commitment to build 40 new hospitals with RAAC hospitals recently prioritised
- It's important to size the hospitals according to the type and quantity of activity there will be in the future
- There are many proprietary black box models in use for estimating acute activity in the future
- Strategy Unit was asked to develop a model to be used across all of the builds, a model owned and operated by the NHS, for the NHS
- The model is provided for use across NHP and the NHS generally and we hope to open source soon

## About us: The Strategy Unit (SU)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}

* An NHS research and analysis consultancy
* Hosted by [NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit](https://www.midlandsandlancashirecsu.nhs.uk/)
* Data Science team is new but rapidly growing

## The NHP model in a nutshell

(Some kind of diagram?)

::: {.notes}
maybe mention about HES?
:::

- Take hospital activity from a baseline year
- Apply change factors outside of our control, such as demographic and non-demographic change
- Apply change factors that can be undertaken to reduce hospital activity (activity mitigators - 120 of them! (give examples))
- Data from the baseline year is sampled to approximate future hospital activity in the horizon year

## Architecture of the NHP model

Check legibility of fonts of diagrams

## NHP model infrastructure

- Inputs and outputs apps in R {shiny} for users to set parameters and explore results
- Model written in Python, triggered via API
- Azure Storage used to store data


## Conclusion

- Future developments incl. Spark
- Much of the methdology and code is already open sourced
- We hope to open source the model code soon (this year)
