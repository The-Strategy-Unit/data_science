## `{targets}` for analysts

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> Tom previously presented at a coffee and coding last March and you can revisit his presentation and learn about the
> reasons why you should use the package to manage your pipeline and see a simple demonstration of how to use the
> package.

> Matt has presented previously about {targets} and making your workflows (pipelines) reproducible.

> So..... if you aren't really even sure why your pipeline needs managing as an analyst or whether you actually have one
> (you do) then links to their presentations are at the end

> In this presentation we aim to demonstrate the real-world use of {targets} in an analysis project, but first a brief
> explanation:
> 1. Write a script
> 2. Execute script
> 3. Make changes
> 4. Go to step 2

> {targets} will
> - learn how the various stages of your analysis fit together
> - save time by only running necessary stages as you cycle through the process
> - help future you and colleagues re-visiting the analysis
> -

## Explain the BHF project

::: incremental
-   original BHF project had 30+ metrics
-   multiple inter-related processing steps
-   each time a metric changed or a process was altered
-   impacts across the project
-   potential for mistakes, duplication, wasted time
-   using targets provides a structure that handles these inter-relationships
:::

## Visualising

Current BHF project in {targets} and visualised with tar_visnetwork()
