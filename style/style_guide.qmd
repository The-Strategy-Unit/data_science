# Style Guide

## Code style

* In general, follow the conventions of the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
* Prefer packages to be explicitly namespaced with a double colon in production code, like `dplyr::mutate()`, though this is not essential in exploratory data analysis.
* Favour the base R pipe (`|>`) over the {magrittr} pipe (`%>%`).
* Avoid `library(tidyverse)` in production code because it attaches a lot of packages that might not be used, though you may use it in exploratory data analysis.
* Use {styler} and {lintr} (or Python equivalents such as `black`) to tidy your code.
* Insert linebreaks in your code at or before column 80.
* Prefer the 'source' rather than the 'visual' editor for Quarto documents in RStudio (see the [instructions for switching](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/documents/visual-editor.html#switching-modes) and remove the `editor: visual` key-value pair in the YAML header).
* When using {dplyr}, favour one mutate over many if [`.by` grouping](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_by.html) isn't being used. For example, between the two examples below, example B is preferred:

Example A:
```
dplyr::starwars |>
  dplyr::mutate(height_cm = height) |>
  dplyr::mutate(name_copy = name)
```

Example B:
```
dplyr::starwars |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    height_cm = height,
    name_copy = name
  )
```

## Line endings

To avoid excessive whitespace cluttering up Git diffs, set your chosen IDE to use LF line endings.

For RStudio, select Tools > Global Options > Code > Saving. Under Serialization, set the Line ending conversion to Posix (LF).

For VSCode, follow [the instructions here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73985251).

You should also change your git settings to checkout in LF by running this in your terminal: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`

Per repository, you can run `git add --renormalize .` to fix line endings.


## Additional assorted notes on style ðŸ˜Ž

* Our preferred date format is [ISO](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): YYYY-MM-DD
* Favour Quarto (`.qmd` files) over R Markdown (`.Rmd`) for document production.
* Use Git for *all* projects and GitHub as the remote home for of all of the project code.
* Use the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) approach wherever possible.
* Line breaks in Markdown (`.md`) files should be at 120 characters or [at sentence breaks](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#write-each-sentence-in-a-new-line-line-breaks).
* When writing about code, use curly braces to identify a {package} name and use backticks around \`functions()\` as these render nicely and highlight the words clearly.
* If you're not sure about something try the [NHS-R Way](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html), the [UK Government accessibility guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps), or the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html). If you're still not sure, just ask the team.
