## The New Hospital Programme (NHP) Demand Model

- An award-winning, fully _**open source**_ model for estimating future hospital activity^[https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/new-hospital-programme-demand-model]
- Used for local hospital planning and to inform national policy

## The model in a nutshell

Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model, providing hundreds of possible futures and an average forecast


## HES: a powerful dataset

* Model data: 500 million anonymised patient records
* Significant data wrangling and infrastructure changes required to process data on this scale
* All code for data processing is openly available - this ensures we're all using the same definitions^[https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data]

## Categories of potentially mitigable activity

92 evidence-based ways in which hospital activity can be reduced in future. Divided into four categories:

- Prevention and public health, e.g. Smoking Related Admissions
- Redirection of activity, e.g. A&E Frequent Attenders
- De-adoption of activities, e.g. Interventions with Limited Evidence
- Efficiencies, e.g. Outpatient Convert to Tele-Attendance

## Creation of new datasets

* Expert elicitation to help model users with estimates of what they think is possible in the future
* Model users' inputs are a helpful insight into what providers think is possible in the future
* Counts of activity that is potentially mitigable at a local/regional/national level^[https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/community_mitigators/]
* Inequalities in planned hospital procedures^[https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/publications/strategies-reduce-inequalities-access-planned-hospital-procedures]

## New datasets in use 

![](planned_ambitious_future.png){fig-alt="Three graphs side by side; the title is Projected beddays compared to baseline of 55 million in 2022/23. the ambitious graph shows a decrease in activity to 46.6 million. The steady graph shows an increase in activity to 76.8 million. The Planned graph shows an increase in activity to 63.5 million."}

## Future ambitions

* Sharing our datasets
* Interactive apps to help users explore and understand supporting datasets
