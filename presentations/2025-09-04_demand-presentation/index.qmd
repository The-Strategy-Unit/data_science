## Prologue

* There is much to say

## Intro

*	**Why** did we build this [model](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/new-hospital-programme-demand-model)
*	**What** does it do
*	**How** was it created
*	What did we learn **when** we were building it
*	**Who** else might use the model in the future
* (Sorry for the last two I saw a pattern and dug in)

## Why?

* New Hospital Programme came to the Strategy Unit c.2020
* Predict demand for the future of the hospitals c.2041
* We built on existing work and knowledge in the SU as well as the literature
* I was not here!

## The landscape

* Lots of models
* Lots of consultancy support
* Lots of repetition / duplication
* BUT no consistency about definitions
* Methodological progress is slow
* Proprietary models means progress is not shared

## Common issues with models

* Handling uncertainty
* Unnecessary aggregation
* Poor coverage of some changes
* Systematic bias in model assumptions
* Lack of ownership and auditability of assumptions

## The principles

* Probabilistic
* Transparent and open source
* Collaborative
* Reproducible
* By the NHS, for the NHS

## So what does it do?

## The big picture

* Demographic change
* Non-demographic change
* Categories of potentially mitigable activity
* More to come

## Demographic change

* Population size
* Population age profile
* Age specific health status

## Non-demographic change

* Medical interventions
* Clinical standards
* Patient expectations

## Categories of potentially mitigable activity

* Admission avoidance
* Length of stay reduction
* Conversion to day procedure/ tele
* Ninety two and counting (will have a look later)

## The products

* [The model](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_model)! 
* [Parameter setting and model run interface](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_inputs)
* [Interactive results explorer](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_outputs)
* [Documentation](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/)
* Categories of potentially mitigable activity (CPMA- no link but more on this later)
* A set of people who have successfully used the model in a business case
* The ability to run the model at regional/ national level

## The model

* Sample the parameters (assume normal)
* Calculate demand at IP, OP, A&E level
* Do this 256 times and plot the distribution
* The results are conceptually at row level, but not in practice

## The national elicitation exercise

## It's a whole separate talk...

* We asked experts to predict likely levels of mitigation in the future, in a structured way
* We also made some whizzy data science tools to do it with- which ended up being really important and useful
* It's not my area so I won't say any more- this was Prof Mohammed and team
* We show these values to trusts to help them make better guesses about the future

## Inputs

* Let's break a rule

## Outputs

* We've come this far, let's break the rule again
* Note to self- if the vibe seems right kick off an "Analysis versus dashboards" bunfight

## Now for the (data) science

## Big list of technical sounding words coming up...

* SQL -> databricks
* Azure compute (Docker)
* Azure BLOB storage
* Python for the model
* R for reporting/ dashboards
* Quarto for documentation

## That's what we did- how did we do it?

## Agile!

* We are not doing "proper" scrum
* Product owner, scrum master, everyone else
* Five week sprints with a one week recovery run between each one
* Sprint planning, sprint catchup, sprint retro

## Sprint retro

* What went well, what could have gone better, and what to improve next time
* Looking at process, not blaming individuals
* Requires maturity and trust to bring up issues, and to respond to them in a constructive way
* Should agree at the end on one process improvement which goes in the next sprint
* We've had some really, really good retros and I think it's a really important process for a team

## What did scrum give the team?

* Simultaneous releases of linked repos
* The team works autonomously in the sprint
* Better conversations about "no"
* The planning and retro process improves the team's processes, not just the code

## Product owner

* My lessson- get out the way
* A better connection between high level and low level planning
* Clear release dates and responsibilities
* Clear what I should be doing

## Agility

* This project was agile whether we liked it or not!
* My 2022 agile definition:
  * Customers can't make up their minds
  * It's hard to design software all at once
  * Continuous delivery keeps customers happy

## Some highlights from [The agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

* "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development"
* "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly"
* "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility"
* "Simplicity- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential"

## How scrum helped

* Those shaping the project wanted to be able to make quick changes- and see the long term plan
* Agility is a mindset, a mode of practice
* If anything we were actually **too** agile
* Being agile is all about being able to review and make decisions frequently
* But it isn't about changing what you're doing all the time
* Good code and good teams are ready to change direction- whether they change or not

## Product!

## What do we want? 

* Prioritised roadmap with appropriate stakeholder engagement!...
* (Fairly) early days
* We need to have structured and useful conversations with our users
* We also need to imagine other users for the products we already have and for the products we might make in the future
* We need to think of what we do not as a set of analytical tools or products but as a service, something that help people in the real world do their real job

## The future

* National and regional model runs
* Bring your own data (FDP?)
* Understanding more about categories of potentially mitigable activity, who thinks what's possible, and why it matters
* Increasing understanding of the shift from hospital to the community
