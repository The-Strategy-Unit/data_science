## Intro

* I got a new job two years ago
* Learning ++
* I want to tell the story
* I've drawn from three wells:
  * Agile/ Scrum
  * MLOps
  * The skills and experience of those around me
* This talk will not properly define scrum or MLOps

## The New Hospital Programme

* January 2023: Development phase
* April-ish: Thinking about deployment
* October-ish: Model is on its way to full production and much remains to do

## Operational mode

* The team was growing in November
* There were two priorities
  * Increase bus factor for Tom (which I'll come back to)
  * Deploy the first production ready version

## The first deployed version

* December-ish: Many needs that were not anticipated
* This first release kicked off lots of other work
* The second release kicked off lots of other work
* It was very hard to do any long term planning
* By March we were confused and tired (and it was all my fault)

## Scrum

* We are not doing "proper" scrum
* Product owner, scrum master, everyone else
* Five week sprints with a one week recovery run between each one
* Sprint planning, sprint catchup, sprint retro
