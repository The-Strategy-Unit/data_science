## Patient experience

* The NHS collects a lot of patient experience data
* Rate the service 1-5 (Very poor... Excellent) but also give written feedback
    * "Parking was difficult"
    * "Doctor was rude"
    * "You saved my life"
* Many organisations lack the staffing to read all of the feedback in a systematic way
* Produce an algorithm to rate theme and "criticality"

## Help people to do their jobs

* Text based data is _complex_ and built on _human experience_
* The tool should enhance, not replace, human understanding
* Enhancing search and filtering
    * If they read 100 comments today, which should they read?
* "A recommendation engine for feedback data"

## Reflect what users want

* I have worked with this data since before it existed 
* I came to realise that people were struggling to read all of their data 
* Fits alongside other work happening within NHSE
    * A framework for understanding patient experience

## Useful

* A fundamental principle is that everyone can use
* If you can run the code, run it
* If you can use the API, use it 
* If you just want the dashboard, use it
* Credit to the [growth charts API](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/growth-charts/digital/about)

## Understandable

* Tuned to the users needs
* Not simply tuning accuracy scores
* Look at the type of mistake the model is making
* Look at the category it's predicting
    * We can lose a few of common unimportant categories 
    * We need to get every rare and important category
    
## Iterative

* Year one
    * 10 categories
    * Moderate criticality performance
    * No deep learning
    * Weak dashboard
    * Positive evaluation
    
## Iterative

* Year two
    * 30-50 categories
    * Strong criticality performance
    * Deep learning
    * Improved dashboard
    * WIP
* Overall five minor versions of algorithm and seven of dashboard

## Documented

* We've documented in the way you usually would
* We were asked in year 1 to provide plain English documentation
* We made [a website](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/PatientExperience-QDC/) with all the product details

## Develop skills of the staff, technical and otherwise

* Year one created a Python programmer
* Year two created an R/ Shiny programmer
* The team has learned: 
    * Static website generation
    * Text cleaning/ searching/ mining
    * Collaborative coding practices
    * Working with and communicating with users
    * Linux, databases, APIs...
    
## Benefits from, and benefits, the community

## Benefits from, and benefits, the community

* We benefit and benefit from
    * NHS-R
    * NHS-Pycom
    * Government Digital Service
    * Colleagues and friends

## Open and reproducible

* Off the shelf, proprietary data collection systems dominate
* They often offer bundled analytic products of low quality
* The DS time can't and doesn't want to offer a complete data system
* How can we best contribute to improving patient experience for patients in the NHS?
    * If the patient experience data won't come to the mountain...

## Open source FTW!

* Often individuals in the NHS don't want private companies to "benefit" from open code
* But if they make their products better with open code the patients win

## Fun!

* Combing through spreadsheets looking for one comment is not fun
* Doing things the same way you did them last year is not fun
* Trying to implement a project that is too complicated is not fun

* Working with a diverse team with different skills is fun
* Accessing high quality documentation to understand a project better is fun*
