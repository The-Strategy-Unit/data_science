## Backstory üìñ

* NHP outputs reports: need automation/reproducibility
* Quarto was the answer... until it wasn't!
* Solution: meet users where they are

## Implementation ‚úèÔ∏è

* Add metadata and store site selections on Azure
* Read SharePoint template, insert content with {officer}
* Write timestamped folder with doc, results, log

::: {.notes}
* How do we identify chosen runs? On Aure, with run_stage metadata on results files and a list of chosen sites.
* How to confirm with model relationship managers? Expose tagged scenarios and sites via a scheduled Quarto-report.
* Basic interface: supply a scheme code, at simplest level.
* Underlying functions save figures and values independently.
* Images inserted by moving the imaginary 'cursor' to a known string of text in the report.
* Value-insertion is more complicated: insert 'field' codes into the report, insert the values to custom document properties, refresh to insert these into the fields.
* The output is a timestamped directory with the report, standalone images and values, and a log.

## 'Doing it right' üíØ

* Github: 'learn by doing', challenge and improve things
* Documentation has saved us!
* The repo is a springboard for parallel/future work

## Reflections ü™û

* Challenge your thinking, be adaptable to user needs
* Embrace agility and acknowledge fragility
* 'The power of friendship' keeps things working

::: {.notes}
* The default mode of 'make a Quarto doc' wasn't the right fit here, but we recognised that and pivoted quickly.
* We know the solution isn't perfect, but it is good enough.
* The process has some frailties, but we recognise them. For example, the report path being changed on SharePoint means we can't retrieve it!
* Talking between us on the code side, but also with the user, is really important to handle changing needs and to keep the process and outputs fir for purpose.
