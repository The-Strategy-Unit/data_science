## The New Hospital Programme (NHP)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}

- A manifesto commitment
- Future activity must be modelled
- Need consistency across schemes

:::

::: {.column width='60%'}

![](kettering-raac.png){width='100%' fig-alt="The headline of a BBC article that says 'Raac: Top floor of Kettering General Hospital Wing vacated'. There is a picture of the hospital with a caption that starts 'crumbling Raac was discovered in the roof."}

::: {.notes}

- Building new hospitals - replacing crumbling infrastructure in some cases, completely new builds in others.
- It's important to size the hospitals according to the type and quantity of activity there will be in the future.
- There are many proprietary black box models in use for estimating healthcare activity in the future - no consistency, difficult to compare results
- Strategy Unit was asked to develop a model to be used across all of the builds: a model owned and operated by the NHS, for the NHS.

::: {.notes}

A probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation that: 

1. Takes hospital activity from a baseline year, using NHS England's Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data
2. Applies variables that:
    + are outside of our control (e.g. population changes, using ONS projections)
    + can reduce hospital activity (mitigators, e.g. virtual wards or teleappointments)
3. Forecasts future demand based on these variables, outputting probabilistic predictive intervals

## Our challenges

* 28 hospitals currently using the model
* Model is being developed whilst in production
* Model is very complex - technically, and for end users

::: {.notes}

1. Hospitals are actively using the model while it is still in development, which can be tricky
2. Dataset is massive for each hospital - hundreds and thousands of rows - all activity for a hospital trust in one year
3. Model can accommodate hundreds of different variables, understanding and setting these can be challenging for end users
4. We have comprehensive, openly available documentation and also a team of Model Relationship Managers to help address this

:::

## Tools and platforms

* Data pipelines: {targets} {{< fa brands r-project >}}
* Model: Python {{< fa brands python >}} in Docker {{< fa brands docker >}}
* Apps: {shiny} with {golem}  {{< fa brands r-project >}} on Posit Connect
* Infrastructure and storage: Azure {{< fa brands microsoft >}}
* Version control and collaboration: Git {{< fa brands git-alt >}} and GitHub {{< fa brands github >}}
* Documentation: Quarto 

::: {.notes}

- The model is built in Python and involves a lot of _pandas_ DataFrame manipulations.
- The data pipeline is orchestrated by {targets} for its recipe-like format and so we re-run only what needs re-running.
- Users input model paramters in one Shiny app and view results in another. This uses modules and {golem} for its package focus.
- We use Azure for storage of model input data and JSON files of results.
- All originally written by Tom.
- As the team has grown we have shared responsibilities: YiWen in Python, Matt with Shiny, Tom as technical lead.

Data is processed from the database by the targets package and stored in an Azure storage account. the model and inputs and outputs apps collected data from there. Selections in the inputs app feed into the model.'}

::: {.notes}

- A targets pipeline prepares the data and passes into an Azure storage account.
- The users, trusts, interact with a Shiny app to set the input parameters. The app provides some contextual information to the user based on the data in Azure. Users click a button to run the model.
- The model runs in a Docker container and we use an API to trigger it.
- The model results are stored, ready for collection and presentation in an outputs app. Users can view charts and tables and download files for further analysis.

## Next

- Move data and pipelines into Databricks
- Open-source model code
- Forecast nationally and regionally
