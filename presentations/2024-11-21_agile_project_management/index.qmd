## Intro

* I got a new job two years ago
* Learning ++
* I want to tell the story
* I've drawn from three wells:
  * Agile/ Scrum
  * MLOps
  * The skills and experience of those around me
* This talk will not properly define scrum or MLOps

## The New Hospital Programme

* January 2023: Development phase
* April-ish: Thinking about deployment
* October-ish: Model is on its way to full production and much remains to do

## Operational mode

* The team was growing in November
* There were two priorities
  * Increase bus factor for Tom (which I'll come back to)
  * Deploy the first production ready version

## The first deployed version

* December-ish: Many needs that were not anticipated
* This first release kicked off lots of other work
* The second release kicked off lots of other work
* It was very hard to do any long term planning
* By March we were confused and tired (and it was all my fault)

## Scrum

* We are not doing "proper" scrum
* Product owner, scrum master, everyone else
* Five week sprints with a one week recovery run between each one
* Sprint planning, sprint catchup, sprint retro

## Sprint retro

* What went well, what could have gone better, and what to improve next time
* Looking at process, not blaming individuals
* Requires maturity and trust to bring up issues, and to respond to them in a constructive way
* Should agree at the end on one process improvement which goes in the next sprint
* We've had some really, really good retros and I think it's a really important process for a team

## What did scrum give the team?

* Simultaneous releases of linked repos
* The team works autonomously in the sprint
* Better conversations about "no"
* The planning and retro process improves the team's processes, not just the code

## Product owner

* My lessson- get out the way
* A better connection between high level and low level planning
* Clear release dates and responsibilities
* Clear what I should be doing

## Agility

* This project was agile whether we liked it or not!
* My 2022 agile definition:
  * Customers can't make up their minds
  * It's hard to design software all at once
  * Continuous delivery keeps customers happy

## Some edited highlights from [The agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

* "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development"
* "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly"
* "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility"
* "Simplicity- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential"

## How scrum helped

* Those shaping the project wanted to be able to make quick changes- and see the long term plan
* Agility is a mindset, a mode of practice
* If anything we were actually **too** agile
* Being agile is all about being able to review and make decisions frequently
* But it isn't about changing what you're doing all the time
* Good code and good teams are ready to change direction- whether they change or not

## MLOps
