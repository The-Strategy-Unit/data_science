## How did we get here?

* Waterfall approaches were used in the early days of software development
  * Requirements; Design; Development; Integration; Testing; Deployment
* You only move to the next stage when the first one is complete
* (although actually it turns out you kind of don't...)

## The road to agile

* Some of the ideas for agile floated around in the 20th century
* Shewart's Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle
* [The New New Product Development Game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game) in 1986
* Scrum (which we'll return to) was proposed in 1993
* In 2001 the Manifesto for Agile Software Development was published

## Agile principles- software and the MVP

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

(these principles and those on following slides copyright Ibid.)

## Agile principles- working with customers

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

## Agile principles- teamwork

* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

## Agile principles- project management

* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

## The agile advantage

* Better use of fixed resources to deliver an unknown outcome, rather than unknown resources to deliver a fixed outcome
* Continuous delivery

## Feature creep

* Users ask for: [everything they need, everything they think they may need, everything they want, everything they think they may want](https://www.dummies.com/book/business-careers-money/business/project-management/agile-project-management-for-dummies-3rd-edition-281622/)

## Regular stakeholder feedback

* Agile teams are very responsive to product feedback 
* The project we're curently working on is **very** agile whether we like it or not
* Our customers never know what they want until we show them something they **don't** want

## More agile advantages

* Early and cheap failure
* Continuous testing and QA
* Reduction in unproductive work
* Team can improve regularly, not just the product

## Agile methods

* There are lots of agile methodologies
* I'm not going to embarrass myself by pretending to understand them
* Examples include Lean, Crystal, and Extreme Programming

## Scrum

* Scrum is the agile methodology we have adopted
* Despite dire warnings to the contrary we have not adopted it wholesale but most of its principles
* The fundamental organising principle of work in scrum is a **sprint** lasting 1-4 weeks
* Each sprint finishes with a defined and useful piece of software that can be shown to/ used by customers

## Product owner

* This person is responsible for the backlog- what goes in to the sprint
* The backlog should be inclusive of all of the things that customers want or might want
* The backlog should be prioritised
* The product owner does this through deep and frequent conversations with customers

## Scrum master helps the scrum team

* "By coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
* Focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
* Influence the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress
* Ensure that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox."

## The backlog

* Having an accurate and well prioritised backlog is key
* Don't estimate the backlog in hours- use "T shirt sizes" or "points"
* People are terrible at estimating how long things take- particularly in software
* Everything in the backlog needs a defined "Done" state

## Sprint planning

* The team, the product owner, and the scrum master plan the sprint
* Sprints should be a fixed length of time less than one month
* The sprint cannot be changed or added to (we break this rule)
* The team works autonomously in the sprint- nobody decides who does what except the team
* Can take three hours and should if it needs to

## Standup

* Every day, for no more than 15 minutes (teams often stand up to reinforce this rule) team and scrum master meet
* Each person answers three questions
  * What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the sprint?
  * What will you do today to help the team finish the sprint?
  * Is there an obstacle blocking you or the team from achieveing the sprint goal

## Sprint retro

* What went well, what could have gone better, and what to improve next time
* Looking at process, not blaming individuals
* Requires maturity and trust to bring up issues, and to respond to them in a constructive way
* Should agree at the end on one process improvement which goes in the next sprint
* We've had some really, really good retros and I think it's a really important process for a team

## Team perspective

* Product owner- that's me
  * Focus, clarity and transparency, team delivery, clear and appropriate responsibilities
* Scrum master- YiWen
* Team member- Matt
* Team member- Rhian

## Scrum values

* Courage
* Focus
* Commitment
* Respect
* Openness

## Using agile outside of software

* Data science is outside of software (IMHO)
  * We don't have daily standups and some of our processes run longer than in software development
