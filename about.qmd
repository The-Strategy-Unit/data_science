The Data Science team at the Strategy Unit comprises the following team members:

- [Chris Beeley](https://github.com/ChrisBeeley)
- [Claire Welsh](https://github.com/DCEW)
- [Francis Barton](https://github.com/francisbarton)
- [Matt Dray](https://github.com/matt-dray)
- [Ozayr Mohammed](https://github.com/O-Mohammed)
- [Rhian Davies](https://github.com/statsRhian)
- [Tom Jemmett](https://github.com/tomjemmett)
- [YiWen Hon](https://github.com/yiwen-h)
- [Eirini Komninou](https://github.com/ai-mindset)
- [Ashionye Aninze](https://github.com/AshAninze)

The team has a wealth of experience in deploying models and other products to the cloud for use by a wide range of users across health and care. This is particularly demonstrated in our work with the New Hospital Programme, where we built and deployed a sophisticated probabilistic demand and capacity model and supported the use of its outputs across the decision-making stages that lead to the construction of a new hospital. The data science team possesses expertise across the breadth of data science activity — for example, statistics, machine learning, natural language processing, and real-time evidence mapping. We also have significant experience in sharing our methods and code as open-source, as well as in training others to use these tools and understand foundational data science concepts and practices. Our experience in developing scalable data science solutions, and open-sourcing them for the benefit of users across health and care, enables us to contribute meaningfully at every stage of a project’s life cycle — from design through to deployment and adoption.

Current and previous projects of note include:

- Work supporting the New Hospitals Programme, including building [a model for predicting the demand and capacity requirements of hospitals in the future](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/), and [a tool for mapping the evidence on this topic](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_evidence_maps).
- The [Patient Experience Qualitative Data Categorisation project](https://the-strategy-unit.github.io/PatientExperience-QDC/) 
- Work supporting the wider analytical community, through events/communities such as [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and [HACA](https://haca-conference.nhs.uk/).
