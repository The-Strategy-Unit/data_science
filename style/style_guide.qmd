# Style Guide

## Code style

* On the whole we follow the conventions of the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
* We prefer packages to be explicitly namespaced like this `dplyr::mutate(...)`. This is not essential in exploratory data analysis but is mandatory in all production code
* For readability please insert line breaks in your code at or before column 80.
* We prefer to avoid loading {tidyverse} because it brings in a lot of packages that are not being used. Again, not essential to follow this in exploratory data analysis but no code that is or will be deployed should ever load {tidyverse}

## unorganised notes

* favour `|>` over `%>%`
* favour `.qmd` over `.rmd`
* use git for *all* projects, github being the home of all of the project code
* RAP everything
* `{styler}`

* `{lintr}`
