## What is Computer Vision (CV)

::: {.fragment}
> Computer vision is a field of **computer science** that focuses on enabling **computers to
> identify and understand objects and people** in **images and videos**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
> Like other types of AI, computer vision seeks to **perform and automate tasks** that **replicate
> human capabilities**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
> In this case, computer vision seeks to replicate both the way **humans see**, and
> the way humans **make sense** of what they see.

## How does CV work? { .inverse}

### for classification tasks

::: {.incremental}
- get a very large corpus or labelled images
- convert the images to a form that the computer can work with (tensors)
- feed into a convolutional neural network
- profit?
:::

## Large corpus of labelled images

### ImageNet

* a large visual database
* over 14 million hand-annotated images
* more than 20,000 categories
* each category has "several hundred" images
* started in 2006

## Convert the images to tensors

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
A fancy way of saying:

turn the images into a 2d table

of values between 0 and 1

> At Mount Sinai, many of the infected patients were **too sick to get out of bed**, and so doctors
> used a **portable chest x-ray machine**. Portable x-ray images **look very different** from those
> created when a patient is standing up. Because of what it learned from Mount Sinai's x-rays, the
> **algorithm began to associate a portable x-ray with illness**. It also **anticipated a high rate
> of pneumonia**.

* Early detection vs over diagnosis
* [Adversarial attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01962) can trick CV algorithms to incorrectly
classify images
* Computational power (environmental impact)

* Explainability of Neural Networks
