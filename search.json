    "section": "",
    "text": "R 4.3.0 was released last week. Anytime you update R you will probably find yourself in the position where no packages are installed. This is by design - the packages that you have installed may need to be updated and recompiled to work under new versions of R.\nYou may find yourself wanting to have all of the packages that you previously used, so one approach that some people take is to copy the previous library folder to the new versions folder. This isn‚Äôt a good idea and could potentially break your R install.\nAnother approach would be to export the list of packages in R before updating and then using that list after you have updated R. This can cause issues though if you install from places other than CRAN, e.g.¬†bioconductor, or from GitHub.\nSome of these approaches are discussed on the RStudio Community Forum. But I prefer an approach of having a ‚Äúspring clean‚Äù, instead only installing the packages that I know that I need.\nI maintain a list of the packages that I used as a gist. Using this, I can then simply run this script on any new R install. In fact, if you click the ‚Äúraw‚Äù button on the gist, and copy that url, you can simply run\nsource(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tomjemmett/c105d3e0fbea7558088f68c65e68e1ed/raw/a1db4b5fa0d24562d16d3f57fe8c25fb0d8aa53e/setup.R\")\nGenerally, sourcing a url is a bad idea - the reason for this is if it‚Äôs not a link that you control, then someone could update the contents and run arbritary code on your machine. In this case, I‚Äôm happy to run this as it‚Äôs my own gist, but you should be mindful if running it yourself!\nIf you look at the script I first install a number of packages from CRAN, then I install packages that only exist on GitHub."

    "text": "I recently discovered a bug in a code-base which needed to be fixed and deployed back to production A.S.A.P., but since the last release the code has moved on significantly. The history looks something a bit like:\nThat is, we have a tag which is the code that is currently in production (which we need to patch), a number of commits after that tag to main (which were separate branches merged via pull requests), and a current development branch.\nI need to somehow: 1. go back to the tagged release, 2. check that code out, 3. patch that code, 4. commit this change, but insert the commit before all of the new commits after the tag\nThere are at least two ways that I know to do this, one would be with an interactive rebase, but I used a slightly longer method, but one I feel is a little less likely to get wrong.\nBelow are the step‚Äôs that I took. One thing I should note is this worked well for my particular issue because the change didn‚Äôt cause any merge conflicts later on."

First though, I want to make sure that if I make a mistake, I‚Äôm not making it on the main branch.\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b apply-hotfix\nThen we can fix our history using the rebase command\ngit rebase hotfix\nWhat this does is it rolls back to the point where the branch that we are rebasing (apply-hotfix) and the hotfix branch both share a common commit (v0.2.0 tag). It then applies the commits in the hotfix branch, before reapplying the commits from apply-hotfix (a.k.a. the main branch).\nOne thing to note, if you have any merge conflicts created by your fix, then the rebase will stop and ask you to fix the merge conflicts. There is some information in the GitHub doc‚Äôs for [resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase][2].\n[2]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase\nAt this point, we can check that the commit history looks correct\ngit log v0.2.0..HEAD\nIf we are happy, then we can apply this to the main branch. I do this by renaming the apply-hotfix branch as main. First, you have to delete the main branch to allow us to rename the branch.\ngit branch -D main\ngit branch -m main\nWe also need to update the other branches to use the new main branch\ngit checkout branch\ngit rebase main\nNow, we should have a history like"

    "text": "What is {targets}?\n\nThe targets package is a Make-like pipeline tool for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.\n\n\n\nData analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. Unchecked, this invalidation creates chronic Sisyphean loop:\n\n\nLaunch the code.\nWait while it runs.\nDiscover an issue.\nRestart from scratch.\n\n\nsource: The {targets} R package user manual"

We can add a new remote for their fork with\n$ git remote add friend https://github.com/friend/test.git\nHere, I name the remote exactly as per the persons GitHub username for no other reason than making it easier to track things later on. You could name this remote whatever you like, but you will need to make sure that the remote url matches their repository correctly.\nWe are now able to checkout their remote branch. First, we will want to fetch their work:\n# make sure to replace the remote name to what you set it to before\n$ git fetch friend\nNow, hopefully they have commited to a branch with a name that you haven‚Äôt used. Let‚Äôs say they created a branch called my_work. You can then simply run\n$ git switch friend/my_work\nThis should checkout the my_work branch locally for you.\nNow, if they have happened to use a branch name that you are already using, or more likely, directly commited to their own main branch, you will need to do checkout to a new branch:\n# replace friend as above to be the name of the remote, and main to be the branch\n# that they have used\n# replace their_work with whatever you want to call this branch locally\n$ git checkout friend/main -b their_work\nYou are now ready to run their code and check everything is good to merge!\nFinally, If you want to clean up your local repository you can remove the new branch that you checked out and the new remote with the following steps:\n# switch back to one of your branches, e.g. main\n$ git checkout main\n\n# then remove the branch that you created above\n$ git branch -D their_work\n\n# you can remove the remote\n$ git remote remove friend"
