## Prologue

* There is much to say

## Intro

*	**Why** did we build this model
*	**What** does it do
*	**How** was it created
*	What did we learn **when** we were building it
*	**Who** else might use the model in the future
* (Sorry for the last two I saw a pattern and dug in)

## Why?

* New Hospital Programme came to the Strategy Unit c.2020
* Predict demand for the future of the hospitals c.2041
* We built on existing work and knowledge in the SU as well as the literature
* I was not here!

## The landscape

* Lots of models
* Lots of consultancy support
* Lots of repetition / duplication
* BUT no consistency about definitions
* Methodological progress is slow
* Proprietary models means progress is not shared

## Common issues with models

* Handling uncertainty
* Unnecessary aggregation
* Poor coverage of some changes
* Systematic bias in model assumptions
* Lack of ownership and auditability of assumptions

## The principles

* Probabilistic
* Transparent and open source
* Collaborative
* Reproducible
* By the NHS, for the NHS

## So what does it do?

## The big picture

* Demographic change
* Non-demographic change
* Categories of potentially mitigable activity
* More to come

## Demographic change

* Population size
* Population age profile
* Age specific health status

## Non-demographic change

* Medical interventions
* Clinical standards
* Patient expectations

## Categories of potentially mitigable activity

* Admission avoidance
* Length of stay reduction
* Conversion to day procedure/ tele
* Ninety two and counting (will have a look later)

## The products

* [The model](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_model)! 
* [Parameter setting and model run interface](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_inputs)
* [Interactive results explorer](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_outputs)
* [Documentation](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/)
* Categories of potentially mitigable activity (CPMA- no link but more on this later)
* A set of people who have successfully used the model in a business case
* The ability to run the model at regional/ national level

## The model

* Sample the parameters (assume normal)
* Calculate demand at IP, OP, A&E level
* Do this 256 times and plot the distribution
* The results are conceptually at row level, but not in practice

## Inputs

* Let's break a rule

## Outputs

* We've come this far, let's break the rule again
* Note to self- if the vibe seems right kick off an "Analysis versus dashboards" bunfight

## Now for the (data) science

## Big list of technical sounding words coming up...

* SQL -> databricks
* Azure compute (Docker)
* Azure BLOB storage
* Python for the model
* R for reporting/ dashboards
* Quarto for documentation

## The future
