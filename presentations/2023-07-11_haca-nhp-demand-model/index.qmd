## Review of existing models

## Review of existing models

- lots of models
- lots of external consultancies
- lots of similarities

. . .

- lots of repetition/duplication
- sufficiently different that comparing results is difficult
- methodological progress slow
- no base to build from

::: {.notes}
- consultancies don't tend to offer products, but services
- difficult to compare different models to understand if differences are methodological or due to assumptions
- same issues seen 20/30 years ago
- learning and expertise gathered tends to be trapped within trusts, or kept secret by consultancies
:::

## Common issues

- handling uncertainty
- unnecessary/early aggregation
- poor coverage of some changes
- lack of ownership & auditability  of assumptions
- conflating demand forecasting with affordability

::: {.notes}
- most models handle changes like demographic changes and the impact of changes in occupancy rates
- but few try to handle addressing inequities, health status adjustment
:::

# "How much, and what types of activity might a hospital need to accommodate in the future?" {.inverse}

::: {.notes}

- difficult problem
- a question that is routinely asked outside of new hospital planning
- a planning problem, not a forecasting problem, health systems want to influence the types and quantities of activity they deliver in future
- difficult to get a handle in confidence, the results should recognise the inherent uncertainty

:::

## Our model

- ~~open source~~ (not quite yet...)
- uses standard, well-known datasets (e.g. HES, ONS population projections)
- currently handles Inpatient admissions, Outpatient attendances, and A&E arrivals 
- extensible and adaptable
- covering all of the change factors
- stochastic Monte-Carlo model to handle uncertainty

## Model Overview

- the baseline data is a year worth of a provider's HES data
- each row in the baseline data is run through a series of steps
- each step creates a factor that says how many times (on average) to sample that row
- the factors are multiplied together and used to create a random Poisson value
- we resample the rows using this random values
- efficiencies are then applied, e.g. LoS reductions, type conversions

::: {.notes}

- IP/OP/A&E data
- complex, but not complicated

::: {.notes}

- uses either patient-level data, or minimal aggregation
- row resampling grouped into 5 broad groups
  - population changes address the changes to the structure of the population and health status over the medium term
  - demand supply imbalances: hospitals are currently struggling to keep pace with demand, so we correct for this to not carry forwards these into the future
  - need supply imbalance: addressing gaps in care that currently exist
  - non-demographic: such as the development of new medical technologies
  - activity mitigators: strategies trusts adopt for reducing activity, or delivering activity more efficiently
- some assumptions set nationally, such as population growth via ONS population projections
- other assumptions set locally, with support from a Shiny app

## Monte Carlo Simulation

:::: {.column}
- We run the model N times, varying the input parameters each time slightly to handle the uncertainty.
- The results of the model are aggregated at the end of each model run

## Model Parameters

- We ask users to provide parameters in the form of 90% confidence intervals
- We can then convert these confidence intervals into distributions
- During the model we sample values from these distributions for each model parameter
- All of the parameters represent the average rate to sample a row of data from the baseline

## Model Parameters

> "We expect in the future to see between a 25% reduction and a 25% increase in this activity"

After resampling, we apply efficiency steps. E.g., similar joins are used to
create column `g`, which is then used to sample a new LOS from a binomial distribution.

:::

## How the model is built

- The model is built in Python and can be run on any machine you can install Python on
- Uses various packages, such as `numpy` and `pandas`
- Reads data in `.parquet` format for efficiency
- Returns aggregated results as a `.json` file
- Could also output full row level results if needed

## How the model is built

- Code is built in a modular approach
- Each activity type (Inpatients/Outpatients/A&E) has its own model code
- Code is reused where possible (e.g. all three models share the code for demographic adjustment)

## How the model is deployed

- Deployed as a Docker Container
- Runs in Azure Container Instances
- Each model run creates a new container, and the container is destroyed when the model run completes

## Data Extraction

- Uses principles of [RAP][RAP], using R + `{targets}` and Sql
- All of the data required to run the model
- Data is extracted from various sources
  * Sql Datawarehouse (HES data)
  * ONS population projections + life expectancy tables
  * Central returns, e.g. KH03
  * ODS data (organisation names, successors)
- Extracted data is uploaded to Azure storage containers
