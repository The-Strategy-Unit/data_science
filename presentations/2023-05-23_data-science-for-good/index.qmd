## Data science should be... 

* Help people to do their jobs 
* Reflect what users want
* Useful
* Understandable
* Iterative
* Develop the skills of the staff, technical and otherwise
* Open and reproducible
* Fun
* Documented
* Benefits from, and benefits, the community

## Patient experience

* The NHS collects a lot of patient experience data
* Rate the service 1-5 (Very poor... Excellent) but also give written feedback
    * "Parking was difficult"
    * "Doctor was rude"
    * "You saved my life"
* Many organisations lack the staffing to read all of the feedback in a systematic way
* Produce an algorithm to rate theme and "criticality"

## Help people to do their jobs

* Tick box scoring is not useful (or accurate)
* Text based data is _complex_ and built on _human experience_
* We're not making word clouds!
* We're not classifying movie reviews or Reddit posts
* The tool should enhance, not replace, human understanding
* "A recommendation engine for feedback data"

## Reflect what users want

* I have worked with this data since before it existed 
* I came to realise that people were struggling to read all of their data 
* Fits alongside other work happening within NHSE
    * A framework for understanding patient experience

## Useful

* A fundamental principle is that everyone can use
* If you can run the code, run it
* If you can use the API, use it 
* If you just want the dashboard, use it

## Understandable

* Tuned to the users needs
* Not simply tuning accuracy scores
* Look at the type of mistake the model is making
* Look at the category it's predicting
    * We can lose a few of common unimportant categories 
    * We need to get every rare and important category
    
## Iterative

* Year one
    * 10 categories
    * Moderate criticality performance
    * No deep learning
    * Weak dashboard
    * Positive evaluation
    
## Iterative

* Year two
    * 30-50 categories
    * Strong criticality performance
    * Deep learning
    * Improved dashboard
    * WIP
* Overall five minor versions of algorithm and seven of dashboard
