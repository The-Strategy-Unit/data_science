## Intro

*	**Why** did we build this [model](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/new-hospital-programme-demand-model)
*	**What** does it do
* **What** are the key design decisions from a policy and technical standpoint

## Why?

* New Hospital Programme came to the Strategy Unit c.2020
* Predict demand for the future of the hospitals c.2041
* We built on existing work and knowledge in the SU as well as the literature
* I was not here!

## The landscape

* Lots of models
* Lots of consultancy support
* Lots of repetition / duplication
* BUT no consistency about definitions
* Methodological progress is slow
* Proprietary models means progress is not shared

## So what does it do?

## The big picture

* Demographic change
* Non-demographic change
* Types of potentially mitigable activity

## The model

* Sample the parameters (assume normal)
* Calculate demand at IP, OP, A&E level
* Do this 256 times and plot the distribution
* The results are conceptually at row level, but not in practice

## The principles

* Probabilistic vs point estimates
* [Transparent and open source](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/transforming-hospital-planning-open-source-demand-and-capacity-model) vs black box & paid
* Collaborative vs top-down (done with vs done to)
* Reproducible vs unverifiable
* By the NHS, for the NHS vs taking money (and skills) out of the NHS
* [(And now award winning)](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/strategy-unit-demand-model-wins-prestigious-florence-nightingale-award)

## Types of potentially mitigable activity

* This is a key task for modellers and a key output of the work
* Definitions
* Local intelligence from collaborative relationships with schemes and ICBs
* The National Elicitation Exercise
* Links with 10 year plan, neighbourhoods agenda, and more

## Types of potentially mitigable activity (TPMA)

* This shows why open source and transparency are so vital- imagine proprietary definitions of these activities!
* (you actually don't need to imagine, we already have that...)

## Now for the (data) science

## Big list of technical sounding words coming up...

* SQL -> databricks
* Azure compute (Docker)
* Azure BLOB storage
* Python for the model
* R for reporting/ dashboards
* Quarto for documentation

## The future

* National and regional model runs
* Bring your own data (FDP?)
* Understanding more about types of potentially mitigable activity, who thinks what's possible, and why it matters
* Increasing understanding of the shift from hospital to the community

## We believe that as far as possible...

* Models should properly account for *uncertainty in prediction*
* Modelling results should be *verifiably reproducible*
* Concepts and definitions (such as of TPMA) should be *open*, *transparent*, and *properly documented*
* The NHS should *develop*, *own*, and *run* key models in use inside the NHS
