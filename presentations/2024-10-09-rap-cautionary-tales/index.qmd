# I am an idiot {.centre .inverse}

## Many moons ago...

:::{ .incremental }

* I received an FOI request
* It was clearly sent to multiple trusts
* It was the second year this request was sent through
* They provided the figures we sent the year before
* I hadn't saved my work from the year before
* I wrote the query to answer the request
* Checked to see I got broadly similar results to the previous year

:::

## My figures were way off {.centre .inverse}

:::{ .fragment }
<div style="position: fixed; top: 50%; left: 50%; -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%); transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">

## What could I have done differently?

:::{ .incremental }
* Saved my Sql query?
* Saved the Excel file along with the query?
* Saved a full set of instructions alongside?
:::

:::{ .fragment }
It’s easy not to do these when it's (seemingly) a super simple request.
:::

:::{ .fragment }
If you haven't got a good structure in your team for where to save these kinds of requests,
then does it even help to save them?
:::

## What would I do differently now?

* Ideally, use something like Quarto (.Qmd) [all one script]
  - query the data from the database
  - do any data transformations needed
  - save the results to the required format
* save it in version control with a sensible name (Year/FOI #?)
* **document what it is doing**
* Make this part of our teams strategy for dealing with FOI's

## Another cautionary example

:::{ .incremental }
* A colleague was the point of contact for one specialty
* They always produced their reports
* One month they were off
* ☎️ "We need the report for our meeting, now"
* What report?
:::

## The report...

:::{ .incremental }
* After a bit of searching I found a couple of different Excel files
* Which one was the most recent?
* Guessed based on time stamps
* Inside the file were three sheets: `Sql`, `Data`, `Table`
* Could I just run the `Sql`, dump it into `Data`, and refresh the `Table`?
* There was no notes or documentation
:::

## Did I provide the correct report for the user? { .center .inverse }

:::{ .fragment }
### 🤷‍♂️
:::

## 🥉/🥈/🥇 RAP is cool and all... but

:::{.incremental}
* There are so many easy wins that get you most of the way
* Consistently save files
* Store any query and steps to reproduce alongside results
* Use PowerQuery or equivalent to automate data->Excel
* Use `.Rmd`/`.Qmd` documents to do everything in one file
* Utilise git/version control
* blah blah blah, docker, CI/CD...
