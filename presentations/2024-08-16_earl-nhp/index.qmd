## The New Hospital Programme (NHP)

::: {.notes}
TODO: Get Chris to look at this slide
:::

- Commitment to build 40 new hospitals
- New hospitals need to be sized for the future needs of the communities they serve
- Our model is the first standardized national approach to this process (??) - rethink and reword

## About us: The Strategy Unit (SU)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}

* An NHS research and analysis consultancy
* Hosted by [NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit](https://www.midlandsandlancashirecsu.nhs.uk/)
* Data Science team is new but rapidly growing

## The NHP model in a nutshell

(Some kind of diagram?)

::: {.notes}
maybe mention about HES?
:::

- Take hospital activity from a baseline year
- Apply change factors outside of our control, such as demographic and non-demographic change
- Apply change factors that can be undertaken to reduce hospital activity (activity mitigators - 120 of them! (give examples))
- Data from the baseline year is sampled to approximate future hospital activity in the horizon year

## Architecture of the NHP model

::: {.notes}
Check legibility of fonts of diagrams

## NHP model infrastructure

- Inputs and outputs apps in R {shiny} for users to set parameters and explore results
- Model written in Python, triggered via API
- Azure Storage used to store data


## Conclusion

- Future developments incl. Spark
- Hope to open source code (are we allowed to say this?)
