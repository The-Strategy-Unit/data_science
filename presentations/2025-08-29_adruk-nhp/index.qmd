## The New Hospital Programme (NHP) Demand Model

- An award-winning, fully _**open source**_ model for estimating future hospital activity^[https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/new-hospital-programme-demand-model]
- Used for local hospital planning and to inform national policy

## The model in a nutshell

Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model, providing hundreds of possible futures and an average forecast


## HES: a powerful dataset

* Model data: 500 million anonymised patient records
* Significant data wrangling and infrastructure changes required to process data on this scale
* All code for data processing is openly available - this ensures we're all using the same definitions^[https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data]

::: {.notes}
* What are the pros and cons of working with NHS data
:::

## 92 Categories of potentially mitigable activity

| Category | Example |
|----------|----------|
| Prevention and public health | Smoking Related Admissions |
| Redirection of activity |A&E Frequent Attenders |
| De-adoption of activities | Interventions with Limited Evidence |
| Efficiencies | Outpatient Convert to Tele-Attendance |


::: {.notes}
* Note that some of these are only possible because we have a national picture of activity, e.g. with A&E frequent attenders 
:::

## Creation of new datasets

* Elicitation exercise showing what activity mitigation experts think might be possible in the future^[https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/10/e084632]
* Model users' inputs are a helpful insight into what providers think is possible in the future
* Counts of activity that is potentially mitigable at a local/regional/national level^[https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/community_mitigators/]
* Inequalities in planned hospital procedures^[https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/publications/strategies-reduce-inequalities-access-planned-hospital-procedures]

## New datasets in use 

![](planned_ambitious_future.png){fig-alt="Three graphs side by side; the title is Projected beddays compared to baseline of 55 million in 2022/23. the ambitious graph shows a decrease in activity to 46.6 million. The steady graph shows an increase in activity to 76.8 million. The Planned graph shows an increase in activity to 63.5 million."}

## Future ambitions

* üîì Sharing our datasets
* üó∫Ô∏è Interactive apps to help users explore and understand our datasets
* üî≠ Continuing to support local hospital planning and national policy
