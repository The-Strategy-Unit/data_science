## Data science should be... 

* Useful
* Help people to do their jobs 
* Solve a real problem
* Open and reproducible
* Understandable 
* Tuned to the users needs
* Reflect what users want
* Fun
* Develop the skills of the staff, technical and otherwise 

## Patient experience

* The NHS collects a lot of patient experience data
* Rate the service 1-5 (Very poor... Excellent) but also give written feedback
    * "Parking was difficult"
    * "Doctor was rude"
    * "You saved my life"
* Many organisations lack the staffing to read all of the feedback in a systematic way

## Help people to do their jobs

* Tick box scoring is not useful (or accurate)
* Text based data is _complex_ and built on _human experience_
* We're not making word clouds!
* We're not classifying movie reviews or Reddit posts
* The tool should enhance, not replace, human understanding
* "A recommendation engine for feedback data"

## Useful 

* I have worked with this data since before it existed 
* I came to realise that people were struggling to read all of their data 
* Fits alongside other work happening within NHSE
    * A framework for understanding patient experience

## Open and reproducible 

* A fundamental principle is that everyone can use
* If you can run the code, run it
* If you can use the API, use it
