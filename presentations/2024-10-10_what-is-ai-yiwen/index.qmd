## AI could help identify high-risk heart patients^[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj620yl96kzo]

The University of Leeds has helped **train an AI system** called Optimise, that looked at **health records** of more than **two million people**.

...

Of those two million records that were scanned, more than **400,000 people** were identified as being high risk for the likes of heart failure, stroke and diabetes.


## How it works

- The input: Health records
- Health records can be structured or unstructured
    - Structured: can be stored in a table
    - Unstructured: can't be stored in a table, different shapes/sizes (e.g. text, audio, images)

## Example of structured data in health records

| ID | BMI | Age | IMD Decile | Smoker | Blood Pressure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1| 17 | 49 | 3 | 1 | 110/70 |
|2| 25 | 67 | 1 | 1 | 129/70 |
|3| 20 | 39 | 8 | 0 | 140/90 |
|4| 28 | 81 | 6 | 0 | 130/85 |
|5| 29 | 41 | 4 | 0 | 120/80 |

Data is consistent within each column in the table.

## Example of unstructured data in health records

| ID | Notes                                                                    |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Shortness of breath                                                      |
| 2  | Patient attended clinic following one week of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. |

The length of each sentence is different - data not consistent.

## A simple approach to classifying data

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Clustering algorithms like K Nearest Neighbours are on the more basic end of the scale, requiring very little computational power.

::: {.column width="40%"}

## More complex approaches to classifying data {.small}

- There are dozens of different algorithms out there
- Complex neural networks can take days to train if the dataset is large enough
- Each algorithm has different strengths and weaknesses

## Is the input or the computation complex?

The University of Leeds has helped **train an AI system** called Optimise, that looked at **health records** of more than **two million people**.

## Pros and cons of simple "A.I." approaches

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Pros:

- Simple models are more easily explained
- Can sometimes find new patterns in the data

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Cons:

- The quality of the data determines the quality of the model
- Not able to handle very complex tasks

::: 
::::

## ðŸš© Issues to look out for ðŸš©

- How complex is the input, or the computational approach?
- Does the model get updated?
- Where did the data come from?
- Have issues of bias or ethics been considered?


::: {.notes}

- Continuously learning, or learning from mistakes vs. snapshot in time
