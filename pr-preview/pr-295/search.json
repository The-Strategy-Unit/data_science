    "text": "Command palette\nRStudio has a powerful built-in Command Palette, which is a special search box that gives instant access to features and settings without needing to find them in the menus. Many of the tips and tricks we discussed can be found by searching in the Palette. Open it with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P.\n\n\n\nOpening the Command Palette.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you forgot how to restart R. If you open the Command Palette and start typing ‘restart’, you’ll see the option ‘Restart R Session’. Clicking it will do exactly that. Handily, the Palette also displays the keyboard shortcut (Control + Shift + F10 on Windows) as a reminder.\nAs for settings, a search for ‘rainbow’ in the Command Palette will find ‘Use rainbow parentheses’, an option to help prevent bracket-mismatch errors by colouring pairs of parentheses. What’s nice is that the checkbox to toggle the feature appears right there in the palette so you can change it immediately.\nI refer to menu paths and keyboard shortcuts in the rest of this post, but bear in mind that you can use the Command Palette instead."

You can upload new themes by clicking the ‘Add’ button and selecting a theme from your computer. They typically have the file extension .rsthemes and can be downloaded from the web, or you can create or tweak one yourself. The {rsthemes} package has a number of options and also allows you to switch between themes and automatically switch between light and dark themes depending on the time of day.\n\n\n\nCustomising the appearance and font.\n\n\nIn the same ‘Appearance’ submenu as the theme settings, you can find an option to change fonts. Monospace fonts, ones where each character takes up the same width, will appear here automatically if you’ve installed them on your computer. One popular font for coding is Fira Code, which has the special property of converting certain sets of characters into ‘ligatures’, which some people find easier to read. For example, the base pipe will appear as a rightward-pointing arrow rather than its constituent vertical-pipe and greater-than symbol (|&gt;)."

    "text": "Panes\n\nLayout\nThe structural layout of RStudio’s panes can be adjusted. One simple thing you can do is minimise and maximise each pane by clicking the window icons in their upper-right corners. This is useful when you want more screen real-estate for a particular pane.\nYou can move pane loations too. Click the ‘Workspace Panes’ button (a square with four more inside it) at the top of the IDE to see a number of settings. For example, you can select ‘Console on the right’ to move the R console to the upper-right pane, which you may prefer for maximimsing the vertical space in which code is shown. You could also click Pane Layout… in this menu to be taken to Tools &gt; Global Options… &gt; Pane layout, where you can click ‘Add Column’ to insert new script panes that allow you to inspect and write multiple files side-by-side.\n\n\nScript navigation\nThe script pane in particular has a nice feature for navigating through sections of your script or Quarto/R Markdown files. Click the ‘Show Document Outline’ button or use the keyboard shortcut Control + Shift + O to slide open a tray that provides a nice indented list of all the sections and function defintions in your file.\nSection headers are auto-detected in a Quarto or R Markdown document wherever the Markdown header markup has been used: one hashmark (#) for a level 1 header, two for level 2, and so on. To add section headers to an R Script, add at least four hyphens after a commented line that starts with #. Use two or more hashes at the start of the comment to increase the nestedness of that section.\n\n# Header ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Section ----\n\n### Subsection ----\n\nNote that Ctrl + Shift + R will open a dialog box for you to input the name of a section header, which will be inserted and automatically padded to 75 characters to provide a strong visual cue between sections.\nAs well as the document outline, there’s also a reminder in the lower-left of the script pane that gives the name of the section that your cursor is currently in. A symbol is also shown: a hashmark means it’s a headed section and an ‘f’ means it’s a function definition. You can click this to jump to other sections.\n\n\n\nNavigating with headers in the R script pane.\n\n\n\n\nBackground jobs\nPerhaps an under-used pane is ‘Background jobs’. This is where you can run a separate R process that keeps your R console free. Go to Tools &gt; Background Jobs &gt; Start Background Job… to expose this tab if it isn’t already listed alongside the R console.\nWhy might you want to do this? As I write this post, there’s a background process to detect changes to the Quarto document that I’m writing and then update a preview I have running in the browser. You can do something similar for Shiny apps. You can continue to develop your app and test things in the console and the app preview will update on save. You won’t need to keep hitting the ‘Render’ or ‘Run app’ button every time you make a change."

We can add a new remote for their fork with\n$ git remote add friend https://github.com/friend/test.git\nHere, I name the remote exactly as per the persons GitHub username for no other reason than making it easier to track things later on. You could name this remote whatever you like, but you will need to make sure that the remote url matches their repository correctly.\nWe are now able to checkout their remote branch. First, we will want to fetch their work:\n# make sure to replace the remote name to what you set it to before\n$ git fetch friend\nNow, hopefully they have commited to a branch with a name that you haven’t used. Let’s say they created a branch called my_work. You can then simply run\n$ git switch friend/my_work\nThis should checkout the my_work branch locally for you.\nNow, if they have happened to use a branch name that you are already using, or more likely, directly commited to their own main branch, you will need to do checkout to a new branch:\n# replace friend as above to be the name of the remote, and main to be the branch\n# that they have used\n# replace their_work with whatever you want to call this branch locally\n$ git checkout friend/main -b their_work\nYou are now ready to run their code and check everything is good to merge!\nFinally, If you want to clean up your local repository you can remove the new branch that you checked out and the new remote with the following steps:\n# switch back to one of your branches, e.g. main\n$ git checkout main\n\n# then remove the branch that you created above\n$ git branch -D their_work\n\n# you can remove the remote\n$ git remote remove friend"

One thing I should note is this worked well for my particular issue because the change didn’t cause any merge conflicts later on."

First though, I want to make sure that if I make a mistake, I’m not making it on the main branch.\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b apply-hotfix\nThen we can fix our history using the rebase command\ngit rebase hotfix\nWhat this does is it rolls back to the point where the branch that we are rebasing (apply-hotfix) and the hotfix branch both share a common commit (v0.2.0 tag). It then applies the commits in the hotfix branch, before reapplying the commits from apply-hotfix (a.k.a. the main branch).\nOne thing to note, if you have any merge conflicts created by your fix, then the rebase will stop and ask you to fix the merge conflicts. There is some information in the GitHub doc’s for [resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase][2].\n[2]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase\nAt this point, we can check that the commit history looks correct\ngit log v0.2.0..HEAD\nIf we are happy, then we can apply this to the main branch. I do this by renaming the apply-hotfix branch as main. First, you have to delete the main branch to allow us to rename the branch.\ngit branch -D main\ngit branch -m main\nWe also need to update the other branches to use the new main branch\ngit checkout branch\ngit rebase main\nNow, we should have a history like"

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with text data, computers need to convert the words into numbers first before being able to work with them.

This step is about naming these milestones and the outcomes.\nIt is important that each milestone-outcome has unique values. An outcome of ‘No response’ can be recorded against the first, second and third invite, and we wish to see these outcomes separately represented on the Sankey (rather than just one ‘No response’), so each outcome must be made unique. In this example we prefix the outcome from each invite with the number of the invite, e.g. ‘Invite 1 No response’.\nThe reason for this will become clearer when we come to plot the Sankey, but for now we produce these milestone-outcomes from our invites table.\n\n\nCode\ndf_milestones &lt;- df_invites |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # everyone starts in the eligible population\n    start_population = \"Eligible population\",\n\n    # work out what happened following the first invite\n    invite_1_outcome = case_when(\n      # if a second invite was sent we assume there was no outcome from the first\n      !is.na(invite_2_date) ~ \"Invitation 1 No response\",\n      # otherwise the overall outcome resulted from the first invite\n      .default = glue(\"Invitation 1 {invite_outcome}\")\n    ),\n\n    # work out what happened following the second invite\n    invite_2_outcome = case_when(\n      # if a third invite was sent we assume there was no outcome from the second\n      !is.na(invite_3_date) ~ \"Invitation 2 No response\",\n      # if a second invite was sent but no third then\n      !is.na(invite_2_date) ~ glue(\"Invitation 2 {invite_outcome}\"),\n      # default to NA if neither of the above are true\n      .default = NA\n    ),\n\n    # work out what happened following the third invite\n    invite_3_outcome = case_when(\n      # if a third invite was sent then the outcome is the overall outcome\n      !is.na(invite_3_date) ~ glue(\"Invitation 3 {invite_outcome}\"),\n      # otherwise mark as NA\n      .default = NA\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  # exclude the dates as they are no longer needed\n  select(-contains(\"_date\")) |&gt;\n  # move the overall invite outcome to the end\n  relocate(invite_outcome, .after = invite_3_outcome)\n\n# view our data\ndf_milestones |&gt;\n  reactable(defaultPageSize = 5)\n\n\n\n\nMilestone-outcomes for participants"

Can you see the relative proportions of participants who did or didn’t respond to our first invite? Marvel at how those who responded to the first invite flow into our final outcome. How about those who didn’t respond to the first invitation go on to receive a second invite?\nPlotly’s charts are interactive. Try hovering your cursor over the nodes and edges to highlight them and a pop-up box will appear giving you additional details. You can reorder the vertical position of the nodes by dragging them above or below an adjacent node.\nThis looks functional."

    "text": "The data science team have been running coffee & coding sessions for just over a year now. When I joined that Strategy Unit, I was really pleased to see these sessions running as I think making time to discuss and share technical knowledge is highly valuable, especially as an organisation grows.\nCoffee and coding sessions run every two weeks and usually take the form of a short presentation, followed by a discussion. Although we have had a variety of different sessions including live coding demos and show and tell for projects.\nWe figured it would be a good idea to do a quick survey of attendees to make sure that the sessions were beneficial and see if there were any suggestions for future sessions. We had 11 responses, all of which were really positive, with 90% agreeing that the sessions are interesting, and over 80% saying that they learn new things. Respondents said that the sessions were well varied across the technical spectrum and that they “almost always learn something useful”.\nThe two main themes of the results were that sessions were inclusive and sparked collaboration. ✨\n\nI like that everyone can contribute\n\n\nIt’s great seeing what else people are doing\n\n\nI get more ideas for future projects\n\nSome of the main suggestions included more content for newer programmers and encouraging the wider analytical team to share real project examples.\nSo with that, why not consider presenting? The sessions are informal and everyone is welcome to contribute. If you’ve got something to share, please let a member of the data science team know.\nAs a reminder, materials for our previous sessions are available under Presentations."

Stocks could be people on a waiting list, on a ward, money, …\nFlows are the rate at which things change in a given time period e.g. admissions per day, referrals per month.\nBehaviour of the system is determined by how the components interact with each other, not what each component does. Mapping the structure of a system like this leads us to identify feedback loops, and consequences of an action - both intended and unintended.\nIn this capacity-constrained model we only need 3 parameters to run the model (exogenous). All the behaviour within the grey box is determined by the interactions of those components (indogenous).\nHow do we get a value/values for referrals per day?\n(currently use specialist software to build and run our models, aim is to get to a point where we can run in open source.)"

This is for good code, problem solving, helping someone - anything that deserves a special mention.\n\n\n\nCore hours vary considerably between team members and there is a lot of flexibility. Team members may send messages out of hours, but that is purely because it works for them, and will not expect anything immediate in response. Flexibility is not only allowed but recommended if it benefits you. Please agree core hours with your line manager and where possible communicate any changes in your core hours to team members via out of office on your calendar and/or Slack (e.g. “I’m out all morning because my car is broken - working later on”).\n\n\n\nThe team is primarily remote. The Strategy Unit has two all company gathering a year, in Birmingham. Currently the Data Science team don’t have any in-person meetings, although we might start doing them occasionally when it’s beneficial. Some of the London-based team coordinate when they work in the office.\n\n\n\nMost of the team’s time is working on a large project which we manage in an agile-like manner. We use GitHub to capture issues, and a project board to manage the sprint.\nTasks outside this project can be managed how you like. If you want to use GitHub, there is a Data Science project planner.\n\n\n\nWe organise a fortnightly coffee and code for analysts in the Strategy Unit.

    "text": "This blog post follows up from a talk I gave last year at coffee and coding about my experiences of learning how to code using Rstudio. Here I build on that talk to share some more reflections and advice for others who are starting out on their R learning journey.\nI have tried to learn R a few times over several years, with mixed success. When I first tried learning it a few years ago, I only managed to learn some basics. The second time, I was going through a crisis of confidence about my ability, and so when I had difficulties with learning R, I thought it was more evidence to show that I couldn’t do it. I tried again, and got to the stage of making a plot with some of the data that was included with Rstudio. Soon after that I got swept up in the demands of everyday life, and gradually my work moved away from the world of quantitative data into qualitative research, and I had fewer opportunities to use R. Still, in the back of my mind I had this strange feeling of both wanting to avoid R, but also wondering what it would have been like if I had persisted with learning it.\nA couple of years later, when I started my current job, I heard about the NHS-R community, and felt encouraged to learn R again. I tried to join my colleagues who were participating in Advent of Code. But I couldn’t understand a lot of what was going on, and when I tried to participate in some of the exercises, I immediately hit some hurdles with the basics, which was discouraging.\nIt seemed important to try and change my approach, so that learning R didn’t seem so daunting. I came across the aRtsy package and was amazed by the colourful and intricate artwork that it could produce. But better still, all of the code was open-source. I experimented with the code, making very small changes to see what kind of images it would create.\nI also discovered colour palettes such as those in the wesanderson package, and tried experimenting with those along with the generative art functions. I soon found that my fear of R was quickly replaced by a geeky fascination with all of the beautiful artwork that could be created with only a few lines of code. It felt like a low-stakes situation, because the worst that could happen was that the code wouldn’t work. Suddenly, the process of coding felt less intimidating, and it had opened up a wealth of possibilities1.\nThe great thing about R is that it is free and open source. I believe this lends itself well to a culture of shared learning. When I joined the SU’s Coffee and Coding sessions and NHS-R community’s Coffee and Code, I felt like a child asking very silly questions, but to my surprise, all of the people I have met have been keen to answer my questions. I learned to recognise and value the people in those communities who would encourage me and fellow learners by making time to answer our questions and help us learn.\nThis meant learning some of the key words and phrases, and getting exposure to the language in various ways: reading learning materials, watching tutorials, and spending time with people who were using it, and writing my own code. This had an incremental effect and over time, the more information I absorbed, the more familiar I became with the terminology.\nIn my day job, I was working on a qualitative case study and wanted to illustrate my findings using geospatial and population density data in the form of a choropleth map. Unfortunately this was one of the most challenging tasks I could have chosen as an R novice, but luckily, I had kind mentors who both believed I could achieve the task and were also on hand to help me learn the skills I needed. So I set myself the goal of trying to learn how to create a choropleth map by the end of the year. This involved breaking the task down into steps, and learning skills which I could build on along the way. I celebrated my small wins, even the tiny ones, until I achieved the goals I set for myself.\nThis involved watching tutorials on YouTube, working through books (such as R for Data Science and R for non-programmers, trying out online coding courses, using search engines and forums, and asking my colleagues and mentors for advice about what resources I should look at as well as what to avoid.\nAlthough learning resources were plentiful, I faced some common barriers when trying to use them. Often tutorials were not always written in a way that I could reproduce the code or access the data they cited, or were written in very technical language, which meant that I had to go away and learn some key concepts to be able to understand them properly. Therefore an important part of the learning journey for me has been to gradually build up a vocabulary of words and concepts in Rstudio. This has enabled me to better understand what key concepts I need to learn, and to understand the content of any training materials or tutorials. I realised that chipping away at it, spending an hour here and there, several times a week, was the best approach for me specifically, with some bigger blocks of time set aside occasionally for more difficult tasks where I could just spend a couple of hours trying out different things or understanding the problem in more depth.\nWhen I became more confident with trying out some packages and functions in R, I decided to find opportunities to apply my learning to real data. I practiced using the inbuilt datasets in Rstudio, the palmerpenguins dataset, and the datasets that were referred to in the books and learning resources I was using. For creating my choropleth maps, I then used data from the UK Census as well as geographical data about local authority geographical boundaries. Applying my learning to real data was an essential step in learning some of the key data wrangling skills.\nOver time I understood that failure is part of the learning journey, and a helpful tool for the learning process itself. If I could figure out what didn’t work, that often gave me information about what had gone wrong. This was useful as it either pointed me towards what I needed to fix, or gave me the words and concepts I could look into to help me solve the problem. Sometimes the process of trying to learn different functions accidentally produced hilariously terrible results2\nAs well as providing some humour to contrast with the often frustrating process of learning to code, these failures also helped me to get unstuck. More often than not, they were a catalyst for problem-solving as they provided useful information about what specific aspect of the code had gone wrong, which would give me a clue about what I needed to look into to fix the problem.\nOne of my worries about trying to learn R was that learning new things took more time, now I was years older than the last time I tried. But I was fairly confident that there must have been other people out there who had successfully learned how to code when they were my age or older. This led to a fascinating rabbit hole of learning about people who had successfully learned to code later in their life and the hidden history of women in coding. I bookmarked these stories so that I could revisit them on the days where I was having a difficult time understanding a particular concept or getting my code to work.\nThroughout my R learning journey, I have found that coding has been a useful conduit for my creativity, and similarly, my creative projects outside of work have been a catalyst for learning some key concepts related to coding3.\nI realised this a few months ago when my friend got me a beginner’s embroidery kit, and as I followed the pattern and learned how to create the different types of embroidery stitch, I reflected that just like with the embroidery pattern I was working on, I needed to structure the coding for the map in layers. This led me to approach the process like I would for an art project4 to identify what I needed to do to adequately visualise both types of data that I wanted to include in the map.\nAs I write this, it has been over a year since I re-started my R learning journey in earnest. Early on in the journey, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the kindness and helpfulness of the community. I decided to channel these feelings into learning as best I could, so that I could then pass the learning on. I was reminded of this when I attended the most recent RPYSOC conference where I once again experienced the warm sense of collaboration and community in NHS-R and NHS.pycom. Therefore my aim for 2025 and beyond is to continue my R learning journey (and become more familiar with GitHub), so that I can give back to the wonderful communities that helped me to find my way."

I have recently begun learning sewing and dressmaking. I have quickly found that the learning journey is just as intimidating, meticulous and complicated as it was for learning R. I have also unintentionally chosen a very complicated project for a beginner, which has resulted in a very steep learning curve and lots of failures and mistakes along the way. Throughout the process, I have applied some of the same principles as I did for learning coding. For example, one of the key parts of my journey of learning sewing and dressmaking has been the process of embracing and learning from failure. This has been essential both in terms of knowing what not to do next time, but also to learn how to fix mistakes, ideally early on in a practice situation (e.g. when creating a mock-up). Luckily there is a large community of supportive fellow learners and patient mentors, who are keen to help with fixing mistakes and to pass on their knowledge to new learners. I’m pleased to say, with a lot of help (and many failures) along the way, I did eventually manage to produce three choropleth maps and submitted them with the report late last year.↩︎\nThroughout the journey I have realised that thinking about the problem like an artist has been very helpful, because it allows me to use a similarly iterative approach. I wanted my choropleth maps to show both the population density and the underlying terrain when superimposed. To do this, I used the colorbrewer2 tool to test out different colour palettes, and changed the opacity and terrain to identify which colours would clearly to show the population data and the terrain underneath. The tool let me test this on an example map and showed me the hexadecimal colour codes for the colours in the palettes. Once I had found some combinations that would likely work for my particular map, I then iteratively adjusted the aesthetics in my R code until I found a combination that worked for my data.  ↩︎"

This is using a 1.5 km radius. In each use case there will be a decision to make regarding a more accurate estimate (smaller radius) and therefore fewer matches versus a less accurate estimate (using a larger radius) and therefore more matches.\nThis approach could be replicated for other similar uses/purposes. A topical example from an SU project is the need to assign population prevalence for hypertension and compare it to current QOF3 data. Again, the prevalence data is a few years old so we have to move the historical data to fit with current practices and this leaves missing data that can be estimated using this method.\n\n\n3 QOF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all GP practices in England, detailing practice achievement results."

    "text": "Advent of Code is an annual event, where daily coding puzzles are released from 1st – 24th December. We ran one of our fortnightly Coffee & Coding sessions introducing Advent of Code to people who code in the Strategy Unit, as well as the concept of test-driven development as a potential way of approaching the puzzles.\nTest-driven development (TDD) is an approach to coding which involves writing the test for a function BEFORE we write the function. This might seem quite counterintuitive, but it makes it easier to identify bugs 🐛 when they are introduced to our code, and ensures that our functions meet all necessary criteria. From my experience, this takes quite a long time to implement and can be quite tedious, but it is definitely worth it overall, especially as your project develops. Testing is also recommended in the NHS Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) guidelines.\nAn interesting thing to note about TDD is that we’re always expecting our first test to fail, and indeed failing tests are useful and important! If we wrote tests that just passed all the time, this would not be useful at all for our code.\nThe way that Advent of Code is structured, with test data for each puzzle and an expected test result, makes it very amenable to a test-driven approach. In order to support this, Matt and I created template repositories for a test-driven approach to Advent of Code, in Python and in R.\nOur goal when setting this up was to introduce others in the Strategy Unit to both TDD and Advent of Code. Advent of code can be challenging and I personally struggle to get past the first week, but it encourages creative (and maybe even fun?!) approaches to coding problems. I’m glad that we had the chance to explore some of the puzzles together in Coffee & Coding – it was interesting to see so many different approaches to the same problem, and hopefully it also gave us all the chance to practice writing tests."

    "text": "R 4.3.0 was released last week. Anytime you update R you will probably find yourself in the position where no packages are installed. This is by design - the packages that you have installed may need to be updated and recompiled to work under new versions of R.\nYou may find yourself wanting to have all of the packages that you previously used, so one approach that some people take is to copy the previous library folder to the new versions folder. This isn’t a good idea and could potentially break your R install.\nAnother approach would be to export the list of packages in R before updating and then using that list after you have updated R. This can cause issues though if you install from places other than CRAN, e.g. bioconductor, or from GitHub.\nSome of these approaches are discussed on the RStudio Community Forum. But I prefer an approach of having a “spring clean”, instead only installing the packages that I know that I need.\nI maintain a list of the packages that I used as a gist. Using this, I can then simply run this script on any new R install. In fact, if you click the “raw” button on the gist, and copy that url, you can simply run\nsource(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tomjemmett/c105d3e0fbea7558088f68c65e68e1ed/raw/a1db4b5fa0d24562d16d3f57fe8c25fb0d8aa53e/setup.R\")\nGenerally, sourcing a url is a bad idea - the reason for this is if it’s not a link that you control, then someone could update the contents and run arbritary code on your machine. In this case, I’m happy to run this as it’s my own gist, but you should be mindful if running it yourself!\nIf you look at the script I first install a number of packages from CRAN, then I install packages that only exist on GitHub."
