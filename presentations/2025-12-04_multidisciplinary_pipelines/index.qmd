## Intro

* This presentation is about building a model to predict the future
* Doing it well required high quality collaboration from a range of staff in different teams with very different skillsets
* I think the stuff "around" the modelling is non-obvious and this presentation is intended to help others treading a similar path

## Why?

* New Hospital Programme came to the Strategy Unit c.2020
* Predict demand for the future of the hospitals c.2041
* We built on existing work and knowledge in the SU as well as the literature
* I was not here!

## The principles

* Probabilistic
* [Transparent and open source](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/transforming-hospital-planning-open-source-demand-and-capacity-model)
* Collaborative
* Reproducible
* By the NHS, for the NHS
* [(And now award winning)](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/strategy-unit-demand-model-wins-prestigious-florence-nightingale-award)

## So what does it do?

## So what does it do?

* Demographic change
* Non-demographic change
* Categories of potentially mitigable activity
* More to come

## The model

* Sample the parameters (assume normal)
* Calculate demand at IP, OP, A&E level
* Do this 256 times and plot the distribution
* The results are conceptually at row level, but not in practice

## Challenges- DS

* Complexity- structure
* Versioning, RAP, and audit
* Processing data pipelines and compute
* RAP e.g. The Org That Shall Not Be Named

## Challenges- users

* Complexity correctness versus accessibility correctness
* DS/ digital perspectives
* Hospital perspective

## Challenges- decision making

* Different analytical teams
* NHP
* Strategic versus operational
* Prioritising

## Challenges- openness and transparency

* The work it takes to actually make this happen
* Running the code
* IG and sharing

## The future

* National and regional model runs
* Bring your own data (FDP?)
* Understanding more about categories of potentially mitigable activity, who thinks what's possible, and why it matters
* Increasing understanding of the shift from hospital to the community
