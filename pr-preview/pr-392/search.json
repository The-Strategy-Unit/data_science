The {usethis} package contains a number of helper functions to help get you started, including usethis::create_project().\n\n\nOne of the most common issues you’ll face when using a project someone else has created, or you created previously, is maintaining the required packages to run the project.

For example, 01_read.R, 02_wrangle.R, 03_model.R, etc.\nYou could still forget to re-run one of the numbered files, however, or it may take a long time to re-run all the steps again if you only make one small change to the code. This is where a workflow manager is useful.\nWe recommend the {targets} R package as a workflow manager. You write a series of steps and {targets} automatically recognises all the relationships between functions and objects as a graph. This means {targets} knows the order that things should be run and knows which bits of code need to be re-run if there are upstream changes. It’s a well-documented and supported package.\n\n\n\nIt’s beneficial to convert code into discrete functions where possible. This makes it easier to:\n\nreduce the chance of errors, because you’ll avoid repetitive and mistake-prone copy-pasting of code\nunderstand your scripts, because code can be condensed into a simpler calls that are easier to read\nreuse your code, because functions allow you to consistently call the same code more than once and can be copied into other projects\ndebug, because the source of an error can be more easily traced and your code can be tested more easily\n\nConsider the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle when deciding whether or not to convert some code into a function. It may be better to write a function if you’ve used the same piece of code more than once in an analysis, especially if it contains many lines.\nFunction names should be short but descriptive and should contain a verb that describes what the function does. For example, get_geospatial_data() may be better than the generic get_data(), which is certainly better than the uninformative data().\nIn a project, it’s conventional to put your functions in a folder called R in the project’s root directory. You can group functions into separate R scripts with meaningful names to make it easier to organise them (read-data.R, model.R, etc). You can then source() these function scripts into your analytical scripts as required.\n\n\n\n\nIt may be beneficial to gather your functions into a discrete package so that you and others can install and reuse them for other projects.\nThe {usethis} package has a number of shortcuts to help you set up a package. You can begin with usethis::create_package() to generate the basic structure and then usethis::use_r and usethis::use_test() to add scripts and {testthat} tests into the correct folder structure.\nWe recommend you include a number of extra files in your package to make its purpose clear and to encourage collaboration.

    "text": "Data Science\n\n\nData science in healthcare is booming. Every day new advances emerge that promise to deepen understanding, improve screening or optimise treatments. But as this panoply of models grows, so does the scrapheap of potentially useful ones that have never helped a single patient. The vast majority of promising new models, even when published in prestigious journals and cited extensively, are never fully translated into clinical practice.\nThere are many reasons for this, and many potential solutions. Viewing a model through the lens of a ‘product’, produced and optimised for ‘customers’, is one potential solution.\nAt The Strategy Unit, our acute demand forecasting model for the New Hospitals Programme has been in use for nearly 2 years. The suite of apps, simulation models, bespoke functions and outputs that make up this ‘model’ has been constantly evolving since its inception.\nThis is a fast-paced environment in which to do data science, since the team are continuously improving the model alongside its active deployment. The NHP model is not ‘new’, and has already had considerable national impact, but there are a whole host of potential applications which we are yet to explore.\nIt is all too easy to get your head down and work away at the next issue in the backlog without realising that doing something else, something you may not even have thought of, could be preferable.\nTo avoid this problem, we have created a ‘product team’ for the NHP model.\nBorrowing from the realm of software development and Scrum, our team has a Product Owner, a Product Manager and a Customer Engagement Manager, all overseen by a project director. The team is in its infancy, but almost immediately the need for it was obvious. The overarching goal of the team is to ensure that the model (and all its component parts) meet the needs of current and future ‘customers’, and prioritising work to ensure the medium and long-term ambitions for the product are met.\nHow we do this requires, first, a brief explanation of the roles of the product team members:\n*Product Owner**: As product owner, it is my responsibility to ensure that the work the data science team does is moving us forward towards our shared goals. This means that I need to have a clear view of the work backlog, how each element relates to the vision for the product and understand the competing priorities coming from our stakeholders. I distil those into plans of action that the data science team can fulfil.\n*Product Manager**: This person’s priority is to have a clear understanding of where we are now. Who are the current users, are their needs being met, what niche does the model fit into currently, who are the main competitors, what are the potential opportunities for growth and development. What are we good at, what could/should we improve? The product manager does not need to be a data scientist but needs to think holistically and be comfortable talking to coders, planners, customers and everyone in between. They have a key role to play in helping prioritise the data science team’s work and contextualising new requests.\nCustomer Engagement: How do we know if the model is fulfilling the needs of our existing customers? What are the pain points? How could we improve the offer? Gathering and assimilating this information is essential if we are to keep the model friction-free and fit-for-purpose. This role is very time consuming and iterative but is crucial to the model’s success and eventual impact.\nOur product team works closely together.\nWe hold regular meetings and end up having ad hoc chats most days.\nWe create our own tools for planning, prioritisation and information dissemination, using whatever software works for us. Currently this means a combination of GitHub projects, Excel workbooks, Quarto documents and Canva. We’ve created a product vision and goal, adopted a prioritisation framework for assessing proposed new functionality, we’ve created Gantt charts and a bespoke product team backlog, and gathered hours of user feedback, all within the first few months of the team’s inception. All this user feedback is fed into the data science team’s work backlog, ensuring that it will be done as determined by our prioritisation exercises. Our current users know that their opinions matter, that we are continually improving a tool that is as intuitive, functional and impactful as they need it to be to do their jobs. Where the product team identifies new use cases for the model, the work to understand the implications of this are captured, examined, and measured.\nThrough conversation and research, we help the team to make decisions around whether a risky new path may be worth the work.\nAlthough data scientists are excellent at building useful tools, conceptualisation of the needs of new users is a different challenge entirely.\nWe want our data scientists to do data science because they love it and excel at it – other tasks should sit with other teams.\nEvery iteration of data science work (we operate in ‘sprints’, meaning we release code every 4 weeks) moves us one increment closer to the ultimate vision for the product, and this journey is transparent, building the trust of stakeholders. The product team helps us sharpen the point of the spear, helping us clarify what we should do and why, and it does so without burdening the data science team with any extra workload. This frees them up to do what they do best.\nIts early days for this way of working, but I believe we’ve already seen benefits.\nThe more our workload grows, the more important it is to have team members whose job it is to help steer the ship where we all want it to go. To realise opportunities and help us make the most of our work."

This was so that we could avoid duplicating our efforts, and explore different potential solutions.\nOur afternoon meeting was just a quick status update; I hadn’t done much coding by lunchtime because I’d spent hours trying to sort out my virtual environment! There’s quite a lot of setup required for some of these more state-of-the-art packages, and Windows isn’t the ideal operating system…\nWe reconvened in the evening to discuss what we’d achieved. It was great having quite a tight deadline - it made me really focus on the task at hand.\nAs an aside, I used ChatGPT to scaffold a lot of my code, and to help with debugging - it saved me so much time!

Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with text data, computers need to convert the words into numbers first before being able to work with them.

    "text": "In the world of data analysis, missing values can feel like puzzle pieces that just won’t fit, leaving analysts frustrated and insights incomplete. But what if I told you that imputing these missing values could be the key to unlocking a treasure trove of insights? By skilfully filling in the gaps, we can enhance the integrity of our datasets and elevate the quality of our analyses.\nThis blog explores the importance of addressing missing data and how an effective imputation strategy can transform incomplete datasets into powerful tools for decision-making.\nRecently, I encountered a challenge while working with a dataset that had approximately 3% missing values. The goal was to match sites that received an intervention with control sites using the {MatchIt} package. However, the package excluded records with missing data, which would have resulted in the loss of around 40 intervention sites.\nFurther investigation revealed the missingness was not at random, which meant that proceeding with a complete-case analysis would have introduced biases into the resulting analysis.\nTo address these issues, I turned to the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) algorithm, implemented in the {mice} package. The MICE algorithm offered a solution by imputing likely values for the missing data which resulted in reduced bias in the resulting analysis and increased accuracy of the matched sites."

    "text": "What’s the problem with missing data?\nWhen datasets contain gaps, whether due to non-response in surveys, data entry errors, or system malfunctions, the integrity of the analysis is compromised.\nIn my case, missing data presented two main challenges. First, the missingness prevented some of my intervention sites from being matched with control sites, which reduced the overall dataset size and excluded important information from my analysis. Second, the type of missingness in my data meant that excluding incomplete records introduced biases into the dataset.\nUnderstanding the type of missingness in your dataset is essential for choosing the right approach to handle it.\n\nTypes of missingness\nMissing data can be categorised into three types:\n\nMissing Completely at Random (MCAR), where the missingness is entirely independent of both observed and unobserved data\nMissing at Random (MAR), where the missingness is related to observed data but not the missing values themselves\nMissing Not at Random (MNAR), where the missingness is related to the unobserved data.\n\nThese types are summarised in the below table along with strategies for handling them.\n\nTypes of missing data in data analysis: theoretical background, Medium\n\n\nMissing Completely at Random (MCAR)\nMissing at Random (MAR)\nMissing Not at Random (MNAR)\n\n\n\n\nThe missingness is completely unrelated to the data (no pattern).\nAnalyses remain unbiased as missingness does not systematically affect the data.\nRemove rows with missing data, or simple imputation using, e.g. mean.\nThe gaps are related to observed variable/s (conditional).\nBiases are introduced if missingness is not accounted for.\nCan be addressed using imputation methods using observed data to predict missing values.\nThe gaps are related to observed variable/s and also to themselves.\nNeed to collect a sample of missing data to be sure.\nAnalysis is biased.\nSophisticated techniques can possibly fix.\n\n\n\nUsing techniques described in the Epidemiologists Handbook, I found that the missingness in my data was non-random, specifically either MAR or MNAR. Since I could not collect any of the missing values (as I was working with a nationally-produced dataset), I decided to treat my data as Missing at Random (MAR), which meant that biases could be introduced if I failed to account for the missingness in the data."

    "text": "Handling missingness\nHandling missingness can be approached through various techniques, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\nOne common method is to delete rows containing missing data (i.e. complete-case analysis). This method is simple to do and is often a default method for statistical packages, however, it is only appropriate for situations where the data is missing completely at random (MCAR).\nAnother approach is imputation, where missing values are filled in based on observed data. Simple methods include the mean or median imputation, which replaces missing values with the average of the observed values. While straightforward, these methods can reduce variability in the dataset. More sophisticated techniques, such as regression imputation, use regression models to predict and fill in missing values based on other variables, providing potentially more accurate estimates, but introducing bias if the model is not well-specified.\nFor more advanced handling of missing data, multiple imputation creates several different imputed datasets and combines the results to account for uncertainty in the missing data. This approach offers more robust estimates and better reflects the variability in the data.\n\n\n\nTechniques for handling missing data"

This indicates that most individuals are clustered around this average age, but there is some variability, with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years.\nThe average (mean) salary is £39,400 with a SD of £7,410. There is a notable spread in salaries, influenced by factors such as age and gender.\nWhile we have established these averages, it’s important to note that neither the age nor salary distribution is perfectly smooth. Several factors contribute to the irregularities observed in the density plots:\nRandomness in data generation: The use of a Poisson distribution for age generation introduces inherent randomness. This randomness can lead to fluctuations in the density curve, resulting in peaks and troughs that may not represent a perfectly normal distribution.\nRelationships between salary and gender: The salary calculations were influenced by both age and gender, creating an ‘n’ shaped distribution where salaries peak for individuals aged 40 to 49 years. The 7% gender pay gap further complicates the distribution, as it introduces additional variability based on gender.\nThese plots represent the complete dataset, showcasing all the complexities we introduced during the data generation process. In many ways, they illustrate an idealised version of data - one that is fully complete, with no missing values and clear relationships between variables. This is often referred to as the “unknowable truth” of the data, as it reflects a perfect scenario that analysts rarely experience in practice.\n\n\nIntroducing missingness in our dataset\nWe will now introduce missingness into our complete dataset, creating a new dataset that reflects a more realistic situation. Specifically, we will implement a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism, where the missingness is conditionally related to other observed variables.\nWe will remove 100 values (10% of the dataset) from each variable based on the following criteria:\nAge missingness: we will randomly select 100 individuals whose salary is above £45,000 and set their age to missing.\nSalary missingness: we will randomly select 100 individuals whose age is below 40 years and set their salary to missing.\nGender missingness: we will randomly select 100 individuals to have their gender value set to missing, independent of other variables.\n\n\nCode\n# take a copy of the complete data\ndf_missing &lt;- df_complete\nseed &lt;- 100\n\n# age - where salary &gt; 45000\nset.seed(seed) # for reproducibility\ndf_missing$age[\n  sample(which(df_complete$salary &gt; 45000), \n         size = 100, \n         replace = FALSE)] &lt;- NA\n  \n# salary - 90 where age &gt; 45, 10 from rest\nset.seed(seed) # for reproducibility\ndf_missing$salary[\n  sample(which(df_complete$age &lt; 40), \n         size = 100, \n         replace = FALSE)] &lt;- NA\n\n# gender - 100 randomly\nset.seed(seed) # for reproducibility\ndf_missing$gender[\n  sample(1:rows, \n         size = 100, \n         replace = FALSE)] &lt;- NA\n\n# see a sample\nmissing_cell_style &lt;- gt::cell_fill(color = \"#ec6555\")\ndf_missing |&gt; \n  dplyr::slice_head(n = 10) |&gt; \n  gt::gt() |&gt; \n  gt::opt_stylize(style = 5, add_row_striping = FALSE) |&gt; \n  # highlight cells with missing values\n  gt::tab_style(\n    style = missing_cell_style,\n    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = age, rows = is.na(age))\n  ) |&gt; \n  gt::tab_style(\n    style = missing_cell_style,\n    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = gender, rows = is.na(gender))\n  ) |&gt; \n  gt::tab_style(\n    style = missing_cell_style,\n    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = salary, rows = is.na(salary))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\ngender\nsalary\n\n\n\n\n36\nMale\n34410\n\n\n47\nMale\n41889\n\n\n29\nMale\n31711\n\n\n40\nFemale\n18838\n\n\n50\nMale\n30264\n\n\n42\nFemale\n33879\n\n\n31\nNA\n29416\n\n\n29\nFemale\nNA\n\n\n47\nFemale\n44293\n\n\n42\nFemale\n50074\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see a sample from our dataset with missingness introduced. Two missing values are shown here, highlighted in red.\nWe will now explore techniques handling this missingness.\n\n\nTechnique 1 - complete-case analysis\nThe complete-case analysis approach, also known as listwise deletion, involves removing any cases that have missing values. This means only observations with complete data for age, gender and salary are used in the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# remove records containing missing values\ndf_removal &lt;-\n  df_missing |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\n# see the result\ncompare_distributions(df_complete = df_complete, df = df_removal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see the original dataset (left, yellow) compared with the newly created dataset (right, blue) produced by omitting records where they contain one or more missing values.\nThis approach has a significant impact on the shape of the distributions, especially for salary. In the dataset with missing values, there is a noticeable gap or ‘chunk’ missing from the right-hand side of the salary distribution. Additionally, the salary standard deviation decreases, indicating there is less variability in the imputed dataset than we know existed in the original complete data.\n\n\nTechnique 2 - substituting averages\nThis technique involves replacing missing values with the mean of the observed values for age and salary.\n\n\nCode\ndf_average &lt;- \n  df_missing |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    age = dplyr::case_match(\n      age,\n      NA ~ mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n      .default = age\n    ) |&gt; \n      round(digits = 0),\n    \n    salary = dplyr::case_match(\n      salary,\n      NA ~ mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),\n      .default = salary\n    ) |&gt; \n      round(digits = 0)\n  )\n\n# see the result\ncompare_distributions(df_complete = df_complete, df = df_average)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique produces unusual distributions, characterised by noticeable spikes in the central region in the newly created data, (right, blue), that result from substituting all missing values with the average. While this method does not significantly alter the mean values, it does lead to much smaller standard deviations for both age and salary. This reduction indicates there is considerably less variability in the imputed data compared to the original dataset.\n\n\nTechnique 3 - linear regression\nIn this technique the missing values are imputed based on a linear regression using the relationships with the other variable. Specifically, salary is imputed based on its relationship with age, and age is imputed based on its relationship with salary.\n\n\nCode\n# model age and salary\nmodel_age &lt;- glm(\n  data = df_missing |&gt; na.omit(),\n  formula = age ~ salary,\n  na.action = \"na.exclude\"\n)\n\nmodel_salary &lt;- glm(\n  data = df_missing |&gt; na.omit(),\n  formula = salary ~ age,\n  na.action = \"na.exclude\"\n)\n\n# fill in details using regression\ndf_regression &lt;-\n  df_missing |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    age_pred = predict(\n      object = model_age,\n      newdata = data.frame(\n        gender = df_average$gender, \n        salary = df_average$salary)\n    ) |&gt; \n      round(digits = 0),\n    \n    salary_pred = predict(\n      object = model_salary,\n      newdata = data.frame(\n        gender = df_average$gender, \n        age = df_average$age)\n    ) |&gt; \n      round(digits = 0),\n    \n    age = dplyr::coalesce(age, age_pred),\n    salary = dplyr::coalesce(salary, salary_pred)\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(-c(age_pred, salary_pred))\n\n# see the result\ncompare_distributions(df_complete = df_complete, df = df_regression)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique also produces unusual distributions, characterised by noticeable spikes in the new dataset (right, blue). Both the imputed age and imputed salary exhibit much smaller standard deviations compared to the original dataset, indicating reduced variability in the imputed data.\n\n\nTechnique 4 - Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)\nThe MICE algorithm works by iteratively imputing missing values using a series of regression models. It initialises missing values with a starting estimate, then for each variable with missing values, creates a regression model using the observed values and other variables. The regression model is used to predict the missing values, and this process is repeated for each variable with missing values, updating the estimates at each iteration. This iterative process is repeated multiple times, creating multiple imputed datasets, which are then combined to obtain a single, final estimate.\n\n\nCode\n# let {mice} suggest an imputation method for each variable\ninit &lt;- mice::mice(df_missing, maxit = 0)\n\n# calculate the imputed values\nimputed &lt;- mice::mice(\n  data = df_missing,          # data to be used\n  m = 10,                     # number of multiple imputations (dflt = 5)\n  method = init$method,       # matching method - will go with default\n  seed = 123,                 # for reproducibility\n  maxit = 10,                 # 10 iterations (default = 5)\n  printFlag = FALSE           # don't print history to the console\n)\n\n# complete the data\ndf_mice &lt;- mice::complete(imputed)\n\n# see the result\ncompare_distributions(df_complete = df_complete, df = df_mice)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see the original dataset (left, yellow) compared with the newly created dataset (right, blue) produced by multiple imputation using the MICE algorithm.\nWhile this approach is not without its imperfections, it provides significantly better estimates for the missing data compared to previous techniques. As a result, the density distributions of the imputed dataset resemble those of the original dataset, indicating a more accurate representation of the underlying data.\n\n\nTechnique review\nWe have explored four techniques for handling missing data: complete-case analysis, mean imputation, linear regression and multiple imputation using the MICE algorithm. Now, let’s consolidate our findings to see how these techniques compare in terms of their effectiveness.\nIn the tables below, we compile the mean and standard deviation (SD) values for age and salary from each technique, along with the absolute differences from the original dataset’s mean and standard deviations. This comparison highlights the performance of each method in imputing missing data.\n\nMICE performs best at imputing age\nThe MICE algorithm performed the best at imputing missing age data, providing mean and standard deviation values that are the closest overall match to the original dataset. While it is not perfect, it significantly improves the accuracy of the imputed values.\nBoth the mean imputation and linear regression techniques performed reasonably well in estimating the average value of age. However, they resulted in significantly different standard deviations compared to the original dataset. This discrepancy indicates that the resulting distributions were altered, as observed in our earlier plot comparisons.\n\n\nCode\n# list the data showing different imputation approaches\ndata &lt;- \n  tibble::tribble(\n    ~df, ~df_name,\n    df_complete, \"Original\",\n    df_removal, \"Complete-case\",\n    df_average, \"Average\",\n    df_regression, \"Regression\",\n    df_mice, \"MICE\"\n  )\n\n# summarise the results to a single df\ndf_summary_test &lt;-\n  purrr::map2_dfr(\n    .x = data$df,\n    .y = data$df_name,\n    .f = \\(.x, .y) {\n      .x |&gt;

We can add a new remote for their fork with\n$ git remote add friend https://github.com/friend/test.git\nHere, I name the remote exactly as per the persons GitHub username for no other reason than making it easier to track things later on. You could name this remote whatever you like, but you will need to make sure that the remote url matches their repository correctly.\nWe are now able to checkout their remote branch. First, we will want to fetch their work:\n# make sure to replace the remote name to what you set it to before\n$ git fetch friend\nNow, hopefully they have commited to a branch with a name that you haven’t used. Let’s say they created a branch called my_work. You can then simply run\n$ git switch friend/my_work\nThis should checkout the my_work branch locally for you.\nNow, if they have happened to use a branch name that you are already using, or more likely, directly commited to their own main branch, you will need to do checkout to a new branch:\n# replace friend as above to be the name of the remote, and main to be the branch\n# that they have used\n# replace their_work with whatever you want to call this branch locally\n$ git checkout friend/main -b their_work\nYou are now ready to run their code and check everything is good to merge!\nFinally, If you want to clean up your local repository you can remove the new branch that you checked out and the new remote with the following steps:\n# switch back to one of your branches, e.g. main\n$ git checkout main\n\n# then remove the branch that you created above\n$ git branch -D their_work\n\n# you can remove the remote\n$ git remote remove friend"

Try hovering your cursor over the nodes and edges to highlight them and a pop-up box will appear giving you additional details. You can reorder the vertical position of the nodes by dragging them above or below an adjacent node.\nThis looks functional."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog post follows up from a talk I gave last year at coffee and coding about my experiences of learning how to code using Rstudio. Here I build on that talk to share some more reflections and advice for others who are starting out on their R learning journey.\nI have tried to learn R a few times over several years, with mixed success. When I first tried learning it a few years ago, I only managed to learn some basics. The second time, I was going through a crisis of confidence about my ability, and so when I had difficulties with learning R, I thought it was more evidence to show that I couldn’t do it. I tried again, and got to the stage of making a plot with some of the data that was included with Rstudio. Soon after that I got swept up in the demands of everyday life, and gradually my work moved away from the world of quantitative data into qualitative research, and I had fewer opportunities to use R. Still, in the back of my mind I had this strange feeling of both wanting to avoid R, but also wondering what it would have been like if I had persisted with learning it.\nA couple of years later, when I started my current job, I heard about the NHS-R community, and felt encouraged to learn R again. I tried to join my colleagues who were participating in Advent of Code. But I couldn’t understand a lot of what was going on, and when I tried to participate in some of the exercises, I immediately hit some hurdles with the basics, which was discouraging.\nIt seemed important to try and change my approach, so that learning R didn’t seem so daunting. I came across the aRtsy package and was amazed by the colourful and intricate artwork that it could produce. But better still, all of the code was open-source. I experimented with the code, making very small changes to see what kind of images it would create.\nI also discovered colour palettes such as those in the wesanderson package, and tried experimenting with those along with the generative art functions. I soon found that my fear of R was quickly replaced by a geeky fascination with all of the beautiful artwork that could be created with only a few lines of code. It felt like a low-stakes situation, because the worst that could happen was that the code wouldn’t work. Suddenly, the process of coding felt less intimidating, and it had opened up a wealth of possibilities1.\nThe great thing about R is that it is free and open source. I believe this lends itself well to a culture of shared learning. When I joined the SU’s Coffee and Coding sessions and NHS-R community’s Coffee and Code, I felt like a child asking very silly questions, but to my surprise, all of the people I have met have been keen to answer my questions. I learned to recognise and value the people in those communities who would encourage me and fellow learners by making time to answer our questions and help us learn.\nThis meant learning some of the key words and phrases, and getting exposure to the language in various ways: reading learning materials, watching tutorials, and spending time with people who were using it, and writing my own code. This had an incremental effect and over time, the more information I absorbed, the more familiar I became with the terminology.\nIn my day job, I was working on a qualitative case study and wanted to illustrate my findings using geospatial and population density data in the form of a choropleth map. Unfortunately this was one of the most challenging tasks I could have chosen as an R novice, but luckily, I had kind mentors who both believed I could achieve the task and were also on hand to help me learn the skills I needed. So I set myself the goal of trying to learn how to create a choropleth map by the end of the year. This involved breaking the task down into steps, and learning skills which I could build on along the way. I celebrated my small wins, even the tiny ones, until I achieved the goals I set for myself.\nThis involved watching tutorials on YouTube, working through books (such as R for Data Science and R for non-programmers, trying out online coding courses, using search engines and forums, and asking my colleagues and mentors for advice about what resources I should look at as well as what to avoid.\nAlthough learning resources were plentiful, I faced some common barriers when trying to use them. Often tutorials were not always written in a way that I could reproduce the code or access the data they cited, or were written in very technical language, which meant that I had to go away and learn some key concepts to be able to understand them properly. Therefore an important part of the learning journey for me has been to gradually build up a vocabulary of words and concepts in Rstudio. This has enabled me to better understand what key concepts I need to learn, and to understand the content of any training materials or tutorials. I realised that chipping away at it, spending an hour here and there, several times a week, was the best approach for me specifically, with some bigger blocks of time set aside occasionally for more difficult tasks where I could just spend a couple of hours trying out different things or understanding the problem in more depth.\nWhen I became more confident with trying out some packages and functions in R, I decided to find opportunities to apply my learning to real data. I practiced using the inbuilt datasets in Rstudio, the palmerpenguins dataset, and the datasets that were referred to in the books and learning resources I was using. For creating my choropleth maps, I then used data from the UK Census as well as geographical data about local authority geographical boundaries. Applying my learning to real data was an essential step in learning some of the key data wrangling skills.\nOver time I understood that failure is part of the learning journey, and a helpful tool for the learning process itself. If I could figure out what didn’t work, that often gave me information about what had gone wrong. This was useful as it either pointed me towards what I needed to fix, or gave me the words and concepts I could look into to help me solve the problem. Sometimes the process of trying to learn different functions accidentally produced hilariously terrible results2\nAs well as providing some humour to contrast with the often frustrating process of learning to code, these failures also helped me to get unstuck. More often than not, they were a catalyst for problem-solving as they provided useful information about what specific aspect of the code had gone wrong, which would give me a clue about what I needed to look into to fix the problem.\nOne of my worries about trying to learn R was that learning new things took more time, now I was years older than the last time I tried. But I was fairly confident that there must have been other people out there who had successfully learned how to code when they were my age or older. This led to a fascinating rabbit hole of learning about people who had successfully learned to code later in their life and the hidden history of women in coding. I bookmarked these stories so that I could revisit them on the days where I was having a difficult time understanding a particular concept or getting my code to work.\nThroughout my R learning journey, I have found that coding has been a useful conduit for my creativity, and similarly, my creative projects outside of work have been a catalyst for learning some key concepts related to coding3.\nI realised this a few months ago when my friend got me a beginner’s embroidery kit, and as I followed the pattern and learned how to create the different types of embroidery stitch, I reflected that just like with the embroidery pattern I was working on, I needed to structure the coding for the map in layers. This led me to approach the process like I would for an art project4 to identify what I needed to do to adequately visualise both types of data that I wanted to include in the map.\nAs I write this, it has been over a year since I re-started my R learning journey in earnest. Early on in the journey, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the kindness and helpfulness of the community. I decided to channel these feelings into learning as best I could, so that I could then pass the learning on. I was reminded of this when I attended the most recent RPYSOC conference where I once again experienced the warm sense of collaboration and community in NHS-R and NHS.pycom. Therefore my aim for 2025 and beyond is to continue my R learning journey (and become more familiar with GitHub), so that I can give back to the wonderful communities that helped me to find my way."

I have recently begun learning sewing and dressmaking. I have quickly found that the learning journey is just as intimidating, meticulous and complicated as it was for learning R. I have also unintentionally chosen a very complicated project for a beginner, which has resulted in a very steep learning curve and lots of failures and mistakes along the way. Throughout the process, I have applied some of the same principles as I did for learning coding. For example, one of the key parts of my journey of learning sewing and dressmaking has been the process of embracing and learning from failure. This has been essential both in terms of knowing what not to do next time, but also to learn how to fix mistakes, ideally early on in a practice situation (e.g. when creating a mock-up). Luckily there is a large community of supportive fellow learners and patient mentors, who are keen to help with fixing mistakes and to pass on their knowledge to new learners. I’m pleased to say, with a lot of help (and many failures) along the way, I did eventually manage to produce three choropleth maps and submitted them with the report late last year.↩︎\nThroughout the journey I have realised that thinking about the problem like an artist has been very helpful, because it allows me to use a similarly iterative approach. I wanted my choropleth maps to show both the population density and the underlying terrain when superimposed. To do this, I used the colorbrewer2 tool to test out different colour palettes, and changed the opacity and terrain to identify which colours would clearly to show the population data and the terrain underneath. The tool let me test this on an example map and showed me the hexadecimal colour codes for the colours in the palettes. Once I had found some combinations that would likely work for my particular map, I then iteratively adjusted the aesthetics in my R code until I found a combination that worked for my data.  ↩︎"

These are:\n\nSprint planning (1 hour) with Product Owner before sprint starts\nSprint kickoff (2.5 hours) at start of sprint, with all team members\nSprint catchups (1 hour) weekly during sprint duration, with all team members\nSprint retro (2 hours) at end of sprint, with all team members\n\nWe have created a GitHub template which acts as a checklist to help us with sorting these, including suggested agendas and useful links. We currently work in 3-week sprints, with 2 weeks for coding and 1 week for Quality Assurance (QA). We then work on other projects between sprints (a “fallow week”), effectively working in 4 week cycles.\n\n\nManaging meetings and tasks\nThe scrummaster leads all meetings during the sprint, taking team members through the agenda. They help people working on the sprint to work out what they are going to do and how they are going to do it. If there are any blockers, the scrummaster helps scrum participants with unblocking them. The scrummaster is responsible for helping members of the sprint keep to deadlines by regularly checking in on progress.\nThe scrummaster works with the Product Owner to work out the priority order of the tasks in the sprint. If there are any unexpected development requests or changes in priority during the sprint, the scrummaster helps to work out what can and can’t move, and helps to distribute tasks equally amongst the team and manage workloads.\nWe manage our sprints using GitHub Projects, and the scrummaster is responsible for helping keep this tidy - for example, by ensuring that any uncompleted issues at the end of a sprint are either closed, or assigned to a new sprint.\n\n\n\nScrummaster in action"

The project that we’re working on has lots of interconnected parts, and there are often external time-sensitive pressures impacting our work as well. Having this broad overview enables the scrummaster to spot potential blockers and issues, and ensure that the product develops in a way that meets the needs of all stakeholders.\n\n\nAn eye for detail: Technical understanding\nThe scrummaster does not necessarily have to be actively involved in the sprint in terms of contributing code, but they should have enough technical knowledge to be able to understand (in broad terms) what the requirements are for each piece of work forming part of the sprint. They should also be able to signpost sprint participants to relevant resources and help them with decision making, where required.\n\n\nCommunication skills\nThe scrummaster coordinates communication between team members working on interconnected elements of tasks, and between the sprint team and key stakeholders. They ensure that development team members have all the information they need to accomplish their sprint goals.\nIn our team, the scrummaster is responsible for writing up the user-facing “model updates”, which provide a broad overview of the developments at the end of each sprint. This often involves translation of complex technical details into human readable terms."

Although we have had a variety of different sessions including live coding demos and show and tell for projects.\nWe figured it would be a good idea to do a quick survey of attendees to make sure that the sessions were beneficial and see if there were any suggestions for future sessions. We had 11 responses, all of which were really positive, with 90% agreeing that the sessions are interesting, and over 80% saying that they learn new things. Respondents said that the sessions were well varied across the technical spectrum and that they “almost always learn something useful”.\nThe two main themes of the results were that sessions were inclusive and sparked collaboration. ✨\n\nI like that everyone can contribute\n\n\nIt’s great seeing what else people are doing\n\n\nI get more ideas for future projects\n\nSome of the main suggestions included more content for newer programmers and encouraging the wider analytical team to share real project examples.\nSo with that, why not consider presenting?

A method of mapping a system as stocks, whose levels can only change due to flows in and flows out. Stocks could be people on a waiting list, on a ward, money, …\nFlows are the rate at which things change in a given time period e.g. admissions per day, referrals per month.\nBehaviour of the system is determined by how the components interact with each other, not what each component does. Mapping the structure of a system like this leads us to identify feedback loops, and consequences of an action - both intended and unintended.\nIn this capacity-constrained model we only need 3 parameters to run the model (exogenous). All the behaviour within the grey box is determined by the interactions of those components (indogenous).\nHow do we get a value/values for referrals per day?\n(currently use specialist software to build and run our models, aim is to get to a point where we can run in open source.)"

So these components, given to us from your inputting your P10 and P90 confidence limits, can either remove some future activity, modify it or reduce length of stay.\n\nForecasts future demand based on these variables, outputting probabilistic predictive intervals.\nThe data needed include HES baseline, ONS populations, national NDG, COVID adjustement (no longer for 23/24), HSA, reference lookups.\nWe need the model to be able to preserve selections, results, version control the data and model Needs to be fast and reactive to user inputs.\nAdded difficulties are that\nHospitals are actively using the model while it is still in development, which can be tricky\nDataset is massive for each hospital - hundreds and thousands of rows - all activity for a hospital trust in one year\nModel can accommodate hundreds of different variables, and more are added over time.\nWe need the model to be backwards compatible, so that we can rerun any historic runs."

The ONS data also lives here, and both are combined and wrangled by the python code in the nhp_data repo to produce the model-ready data version which lives in Azure.\nThe inputs data is pulled in to the inputs app, which lives on Posit Connect and which you should all be familiar with. This enables users to see historic trends for mitigator activity in their scheme, look at summary counts etc.\nEvery time to move a slider or make a selecion on the inputs app, those data are captured by a reactive JSON file that preserves all the metadata for your model run. This is also kept on Connect.\nWhen you click Run, the JSON is sent via the API to the model, whose code lives in the nhp_model repo and is written in python.\n\n\nThe model spins up a new Docker image on the Azure Container Registry in which to run the model as I described previously.\nThe output is the results parquet file, which is saved onto the Azure storage.\nFinally, the outputs app, also on Connect, picks up this results file and uses it to display all the charts and summaries you’re used to, as well as allowing you to download the results.\n\nAll these datasets, the inputs, results and JSON files are preserved for the future."

We pick and choose the elements of these approaches as we see fit.\nThe reason for using it is to help us coordinate our activities across all these codebases and through all this complexity. It also helps us to push back on work if needed.\nWe have recently shortened the length of our sprints to release code more frequently and prevent large, tricky pieces of work becoming blocked for too long. We’re being agile about trying this out!\nAt the start of each sprint we hold a meeting to go through all the work elements to be delivered in that sprint, decide who is doing what, and ensure that all issues are clear and complete enough to avoid ambiguity. We need to have sub-issues that accurately reflect the quantity and distribution of work coming down the line to help us prioritise.\nEvery week on Monday we catch-up around the sprint and talk about whether we are on course, what needs to happen next and ensure we are sticking to deadlines.\nAt the end of every sprint we have an open discussion about what went well or otherwise.\nThe team needs to have deep expertise, but each person’s expertise covers different areas. The ‘T-shape’ indicates a broad understanding/skillset that enables work sharing and reduces bus-factor, and the downwards element shows that depth of expertise that we call upon - things like data engineering, statistics, documentation, app building, project management.\nHow we decide what we work on when is an evolving area. We aim to have logical, transparent tools for prioritising our work plan, which is sufficiently disseminated that stakeholders feel ‘in-the-loop’ and our staff do not burn out.\nWe also use Scrum principles around nominated roles within the team, I’ll go through the main ones now."

This is so that you as a developer can adjust settings. When sharing with users, do not share the URL to this view!

We’re suggesting you use the deploy.R method for consistency. The push-button method relies on an rsconnect/ folder that gets autogenerated on your local machine, which is not obvious to other potential deployers of your app.\nRecently we changed from one server to another. The new server has taken the same address as the old one so that all of our URLs stay consistent from the users’ perspectives.

Its repo is open, so you can go and look at all the code used to create it.\nIn essence we will aim to provide outputs that best meet the needs of our model users, to maximise the impact of the modelling and communicate the uncertainty around estimates as clearly as we can.\nWe also make use of ‘brand.yml’ to be consistent in the appearance of our NHP outputs.

We are currently on version 3.4 of the model\n\n\n\n\nData Log\n\n\nOn another page of the Quarto website, we have a data log. As you can see, the data are named the same as the model versions, and we have history here going right back to the begining of the model lifespan.\nRelease notes are linked to and held on the nhp_data repository, which is also open source. Lets follow one of these release notes links to see the kinds of information stored.\n\n\n\n\nThe Strategy Unit GitHub\n\n\nHere in GitHub you can see the release notes for the current version of the model, v3.4.0. These notes are partly auto-generated by GitHub through collating the pull request comments on the elements merged to create this release, but we also might overwrite or simplify some things.\nFor instance we can see that Tom merged PR number 89 that replace the AEC mitigators with the new SDEC ones.

The various datasets cover different timescales and consequently changes in GP practices over time have left me with mismatching datasets.\n1 An ICB (Integrated Care Board) is a statutory NHS organisation responsible for planning health services for their local populationsMy approach has been to take as the basis of my project a recent GP List. Later in my project I want to perform calculations at a GP practice level based on an underlying health need and the data for this need is a CHD prevalence value from a dataset that is around 8 years old, and for which there is no update or alternative. From my recent list of 6454 practices, when I match to the need dataset, I am left with 151 practices without a value for need. If I remove these practices from the analysis then this could impact the analysis by sub-ICB since often a group of practices in the same area could be subject to changes, mergers and reorganisation.\nHere’s the packages and some demo objects to work with to create an example for two practices:\n\n\nCode\n# Packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidygeocoder)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(viridisLite)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n# Create some data with two practices with no need data\n# and a selection of practices locally with need data\npractices &lt;- tribble(\n  ~practice_code, ~postcode, ~has_orig_need, ~value,\n  \"P1\", \"CV1 4FS\", 0, NA,\n  \"P2\", \"CV1 3GB\", 1, 7.3,\n  \"P3\", \"CV11 5TW\", 1, 6.9,\n  \"P4\", \"CV6 3HZ\", 1, 7.1,\n  \"P5\", \"CV6 1HS\", 1, 7.7,\n  \"P6\", \"CV6 5DF\", 1, 8.2,\n  \"P7\", \"CV6 3FA\", 1, 7.9,\n  \"P8\", \"CV1 2DL\", 1, 7.5,\n  \"P9\", \"CV1 4JH\", 1, 7.7,\n  \"P10\", \"CV10 0GQ\", 1, 7.5,\n  \"P11\", \"CV10 0JH\", 1, 7.8,\n  \"P12\", \"CV11 5QT\", 0, NA,\n  \"P13\", \"CV11 6AB\", 1, 7.6,\n  \"P14\", \"CV6 4DD\", 1, 7.9\n)\n\n# get domain of numeric data\n(domain &lt;- range(practices$has_orig_need))\n\n# make a colour palette\npal &lt;- colorNumeric(palette = viridis(2), domain = domain)\n\n\nTo provide a suitable estimate of need for the newer practices without values, all the practices in the dataset were geocoded2 using the geocode function from the {tidygeocoder} package.\n2 Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (often the postcode) into geographic coordinates (such as latitude and longitude) that can be plotted on a map.\npractices &lt;- practices |&gt;\n  mutate(id = row_number()) |&gt;\n  geocode(postalcode = postcode) |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"long\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n\n\n\nCode\npractices |&gt;\n  gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npractice_code\npostcode\nhas_orig_need\nvalue\nid\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\nP1\nCV1 4FS\n0\nNA\n1\nc(-1.50672203333333, 52.4140662333333)\n\n\nP2\nCV1 3GB\n1\n7.3\n2\nc(-1.51888, 52.4034199)\n\n\nP3\nCV11 5TW\n1\n6.9\n3\nc(-1.46746, 52.519)\n\n\nP4\nCV6 3HZ\n1\n7.1\n4\nc(-1.52231, 52.42367)\n\n\nP5\nCV6 1HS\n1\n7.7\n5\nc(-1.52542, 52.41989)\n\n\nP6\nCV6 5DF\n1\n8.2\n6\nc(-1.498344825, 52.4250186)\n\n\nP7\nCV6 3FA\n1\n7.9\n7\nc(-1.51787, 52.43135)\n\n\nP8\nCV1 2DL\n1\n7.5\n8\nc(-1.49105, 52.40582)\n\n\nP9\nCV1 4JH\n1\n7.7\n9\nc(-1.5069566, 52.4191685)\n\n\nP10\nCV10 0GQ\n1\n7.5\n10\nc(-1.52197, 52.54074)\n\n\nP11\nCV10 0JH\n1\n7.8\n11\nc(-1.5163199, 52.53723)\n\n\nP12\nCV11 5QT\n0\nNA\n12\nc(-1.46927, 52.51899)\n\n\nP13\nCV11 6AB\n1\n7.6\n13\nc(-1.45822, 52.52682)\n\n\nP14\nCV6 4DD\n1\n7.9\n14\nc(-1.50832, 52.44104)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows the practices, purple are the practices with no need data and yellow are practices with need data available.\n\n\nCode\n# make map to display practices\nleaflet(practices) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(color = ~ pal(has_orig_need))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data was split into those with, and without, a value for need.

This is using a 1.5 km radius. In each use case there will be a decision to make regarding a more accurate estimate (smaller radius) and therefore fewer matches versus a less accurate estimate (using a larger radius) and therefore more matches.\nThis approach could be replicated for other similar uses/purposes. A topical example from an SU project is the need to assign population prevalence for hypertension and compare it to current QOF3 data. Again, the prevalence data is a few years old so we have to move the historical data to fit with current practices and this leaves missing data that can be estimated using this method.\n\n\n3 QOF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all GP practices in England, detailing practice achievement results."

    "text": "Advent of Code is an annual event, where daily coding puzzles are released from 1st – 24th December. We ran one of our fortnightly Coffee & Coding sessions introducing Advent of Code to people who code in the Strategy Unit, as well as the concept of test-driven development as a potential way of approaching the puzzles.\nTest-driven development (TDD) is an approach to coding which involves writing the test for a function BEFORE we write the function. This might seem quite counterintuitive, but it makes it easier to identify bugs 🐛 when they are introduced to our code, and ensures that our functions meet all necessary criteria. From my experience, this takes quite a long time to implement and can be quite tedious, but it is definitely worth it overall, especially as your project develops. Testing is also recommended in the NHS Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) guidelines.\nAn interesting thing to note about TDD is that we’re always expecting our first test to fail, and indeed failing tests are useful and important! If we wrote tests that just passed all the time, this would not be useful at all for our code.\nThe way that Advent of Code is structured, with test data for each puzzle and an expected test result, makes it very amenable to a test-driven approach. In order to support this, Matt and I created template repositories for a test-driven approach to Advent of Code, in Python and in R.\nOur goal when setting this up was to introduce others in the Strategy Unit to both TDD and Advent of Code. Advent of code can be challenging and I personally struggle to get past the first week, but it encourages creative (and maybe even fun?!) approaches to coding problems. I’m glad that we had the chance to explore some of the puzzles together in Coffee & Coding – it was interesting to see so many different approaches to the same problem, and hopefully it also gave us all the chance to practice writing tests."

    "text": "The clever cookies at Posit (creators of RStudio) recently released Positron, their new ‘next generation’ integrated development environment (IDE), after 2+ years of development. This software is multilingual, and will look familiar to those who have used VSCode in the past. It has been created to build upon the successes of RStudio for statistical computing and graphics, to create a seamless workflow for the development of data science projects. It’s a lovely piece of software that I’ve recently started working with and is providing me with some useful features to help in my role as a product owner. I wanted to give a little round-up of what I’ve found useful with it so far, for someone whose daily tasks differ from standard data science or analysis (but includes elements of both).\nFirstly, what do I mean by a ‘product owner’? I’ll keep this brief since there is already so much out there that eloquently describes this role and its relationship with others in the Agile universe. Essentially, my job is to ensure our data science team is building the right thing, at the right time, for our customers.\nThe data science team’s time is spent marshalling their wizardry (as it seems to me) to write code, create packages, and curate workflows to meet the requirements for the tasks at hand. My job is to make sure those tasks are the right ones for meeting customer needs. This involves a lot of thinking about stakeholder requirements, translating them to a prioritised list of tools or functionality elements that will truly answer their questions, gathering and assessing user feedback, improving the user experience, and trying to find the sweet spot where the time, money and effort spent on development is appropriate for the value of the new thing for the customer.\nI’m a data scientist myself, with a background in R and Python. I love writing code and building R packages and have done so in RStudio for some time now. A product owner’s working week is more focused on planning, prioritising, prioritising again, thinking about processes, documenting decisions and so forth.\nBut to contribute to our team’s work I also write little bits of code, write documentation, create diagrams and infographics, undertake some QA, review PRs and so forth. Positron has made many of these elements easy and smooth. Here’s a round-up of the ways Positron is helping me with the day job:"

The GitHub interface in RStudio was ok, but I still found myself using the command line, which felt like it interrupted my flow of work to a degree. Positron provides for the ability to never have to leave the IDE. Once you have authenticated your GitHub account in Positron, you can click the GitHub icon in the activity panel to see all the pull requests and issues for that repo. You can create PRs from that menu too – it’s all self-explanatory and works really well. Clicking on one of your repo issues will also open it as an additional tab in the editor pane, and you can interact with it there just as you would at github.com! No need to have browsers and shells open, it’s all just there. This helps my workflow massively, allowing me to keep my train of thought going."

The whole book is searchable, so it’s easy to find the notes I’m looking for, and Positron makes working with Quarto very easy. Positron comes with a bootstrapped Quarto extension and the CLI is bundled with Positron, so no extra setup is needed. I can create my planning documents, with nice mermaid flow diagrams and such, and I can publish them easily from Positron to share with my team. I’ve written a package that I can use within the IDE to automatically append notes to any of the .qmd pages of my notes book. I can even create diagrams and charts in the IDE, and save them into my notes. If the diagram is complex, I can append the code chunks and output to my book too, since that’s what Quarto is great at.\n\nI love Positron’s feature that allows scrolling back through the iterations of a plot too, which makes rolling the code back to a preferred solution nice and simple."

Using Positron allows me to use a very similar workflow to my familiar RStudio one, including using {devtools} for documenting and running package checks and using devtools::load_all() to test out new functionality locally. In addition to this, Positron makes working with tests really simple (which is saying something coming from me!). The ‘testing’ icon in the activity pane opens a dedicated interface sidebar, which neatly displays your tests and their results (provided you are in a package folder). It lets you easily rerun failing tests, see their error messages, and rerun batches of tests or all tests at once. This is a really great addition to the IDE."

My favourite features so far are having my code formatted automatically when I save an R or Quarto file by the excellent Air formatter (shipped as standard with Positron), using code snippets to get the syntax of common functions right first time, and the cool multi-cursor for editing in multiple places at once!\n\n\nOverall, Positron feels like a nice place to be.

    "text": "Recently, we’ve been working on building an internal dashboard to monitor the repositories in our GitHub organisation. The intention is to perform various checks, such as ensuring each repo has a CODEOWNERS file.\nGitHub has a REST API that can do all of the things we need, but we hit a bit of a snag early on. We want this dashboard to update itself on our Posit Connect server—but authenticating with the GitHub API requires a Personal Access Token (PAT).\nPATs are useful, but they’re managed by a user (not an organisation), and ideally should be short-lived and expire regularly.\nWhat we really need is a more robust way of authenticating with GitHub."

    "text": "GitHub Apps\n\nA GitHub App is a type of integration that you can build to interact with and extend the functionality of GitHub. You can build a GitHub App to provide flexibility and reduce friction in your processes, without needing to sign in a user or create a service account.\nCommon use cases for GitHub Apps include:\n\nAutomating tasks or background processes\n\n…\n\nAbout GitHub Apps.\nSounds ideal, right? And it turns out it’s pretty easy to create your own app too! Well, there are a few steps, and a bit of boilerplate code to write, but I’ll get to that later.\nIf you explore that link, you’ll find all the details needed to create your own app—but I’ll quickly note the steps I took below.\n\nCreating the App\n\nGo to your organisation’s Settings page on GitHub.\nAt the bottom of the left-hand navigation, find Developer settings and choose GitHub Apps.\nClick the New GitHub App button.\nGive it a name (I named ours “Strategy Unit GitHub Dashboard”).\nFor the Homepage URL, set it to where the app will be deployed.\nSkip down to Webhook and uncheck the Active checkbox.\nGrant the app only the minimum permissions required. In my case, I gave repository metadata read access—additional permissions can be granted later if needed.\nLeave Where can this GitHub App be Installed? set to Only on this account.\nClick Create GitHub App.\nOn the newly created app page, a small menu should appear on the left with Install App near the bottom. Use that to install the app into your organisation.\nBack on the app’s settings page, note the App ID near the top.\nAt the bottom of the settings page, click Generate a private key—this will download a private key for later use.\n\n\n\nUsing the App\nWe can now use the app to authenticate with the GitHub API. But to perform requests—like listing repositories—we still need a token.\nWait, I thought we were trying to avoid using PATs?\nWell… yes. But we’ll use the GitHub App to generate a PAT for us!\nLet me outline the workflow and show how to generate the token using R and the {httr2} package.\nIf you haven’t used {httr2} before, the final code example includes extra comments explaining what’s going on.\n\n1. Generate a JWT\nFirst, we need to create a JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by our app (using the App ID and private key from earlier):\n\n\nshow code for get_github_jwt()\n#' Get GitHub JWT for an Application\n#'\n#' @param key Path to the private key file or a string containing the private\n#'     key. Defaults to the environment variable `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.\n#' @param app_id GitHub App ID. Defaults to the environment variable\n#'     `GITHUB_APP_ID`.\n#' @param expiry_time Expiry time for the JWT in seconds. Defaults to 30s.\n#'\n#' @return A JSON Web Token (JWT) for the GitHub App.\nget_github_jwt &lt;- function(\n    key = Sys.getenv(\"GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY\"),\n    app_id = Sys.getenv(\"GITHUB_APP_ID\"),\n    expiry_time = 30) {\n  private_key &lt;- openssl::read_key(key)\n\n  now &lt;- as.numeric(Sys.time())\n  claim &lt;- httr2::jwt_claim(\n    iat = now,\n    exp = now + expiry_time,\n    iss = app_id\n  )\n\n  httr2::jwt_encode_sig(claim, key = private_key)\n}\n\n\n\n\n2. Get the Installation ID for the App\nNext, we need the App’s installation ID.\nYou could find it manually via your organisation’s settings page under Installed Apps, but that’s cumbersome. Instead, we’ll use the API and our JWT to fetch it. Since we created the app and restricted installation to our org only, we can assume there’s just one installation.\n\n\nshow code for get_github_app_installation_id()\n#' Get GitHub PAT from Installation Access Token\n#'\n#' @param jwt JSON Web Token (JWT) for the GitHub App. Defaults to the output of\n#'     `get_github_jwt()`.\n#' @param installation_id GitHub Installation ID.

Generate a PAT\nWe’re now ready to generate the token we’ll use for API requests.\n\n\nshow code for get_github_iat_pat()\n#' Get GitHub PAT from Installation Access Token\n#'\n#' @param jwt JSON Web Token (JWT) for the GitHub App. Defaults to the output of\n#'     `get_github_jwt()`.\n#' @param installation_id GitHub Installation ID.

    "text": "R 4.3.0 was released last week. Anytime you update R you will probably find yourself in the position where no packages are installed. This is by design - the packages that you have installed may need to be updated and recompiled to work under new versions of R.\nYou may find yourself wanting to have all of the packages that you previously used, so one approach that some people take is to copy the previous library folder to the new versions folder. This isn’t a good idea and could potentially break your R install.\nAnother approach would be to export the list of packages in R before updating and then using that list after you have updated R. This can cause issues though if you install from places other than CRAN, e.g. bioconductor, or from GitHub.\nSome of these approaches are discussed on the RStudio Community Forum. But I prefer an approach of having a “spring clean”, instead only installing the packages that I know that I need.\nI maintain a list of the packages that I used as a gist. Using this, I can then simply run this script on any new R install. In fact, if you click the “raw” button on the gist, and copy that url, you can simply run\nsource(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tomjemmett/c105d3e0fbea7558088f68c65e68e1ed/raw/a1db4b5fa0d24562d16d3f57fe8c25fb0d8aa53e/setup.R\")\nGenerally, sourcing a url is a bad idea - the reason for this is if it’s not a link that you control, then someone could update the contents and run arbritary code on your machine. In this case, I’m happy to run this as it’s my own gist, but you should be mindful if running it yourself!\nIf you look at the script I first install a number of packages from CRAN, then I install packages that only exist on GitHub."

Monospace fonts, ones where each character takes up the same width, will appear here automatically if you’ve installed them on your computer. One popular font for coding is Fira Code, which has the special property of converting certain sets of characters into ‘ligatures’, which some people find easier to read.

One simple thing you can do is minimise and maximise each pane by clicking the window icons in their upper-right corners. This is useful when you want more screen real-estate for a particular pane.\nYou can move pane loations too. Click the ‘Workspace Panes’ button (a square with four more inside it) at the top of the IDE to see a number of settings. For example, you can select ‘Console on the right’ to move the R console to the upper-right pane, which you may prefer for maximimsing the vertical space in which code is shown. You could also click Pane Layout… in this menu to be taken to Tools &gt; Global Options… &gt; Pane layout, where you can click ‘Add Column’ to insert new script panes that allow you to inspect and write multiple files side-by-side.\n\n\nScript navigation\nThe script pane in particular has a nice feature for navigating through sections of your script or Quarto/R Markdown files. Click the ‘Show Document Outline’ button or use the keyboard shortcut Control + Shift + O to slide open a tray that provides a nice indented list of all the sections and function defintions in your file.\nSection headers are auto-detected in a Quarto or R Markdown document wherever the Markdown header markup has been used: one hashmark (#) for a level 1 header, two for level 2, and so on. To add section headers to an R Script, add at least four hyphens after a commented line that starts with #. Use two or more hashes at the start of the comment to increase the nestedness of that section.\n\n# Header ------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Section ----\n\n### Subsection ----\n\nNote that Ctrl + Shift + R will open a dialog box for you to input the name of a section header, which will be inserted and automatically padded to 75 characters to provide a strong visual cue between sections.\nAs well as the document outline, there’s also a reminder in the lower-left of the script pane that gives the name of the section that your cursor is currently in. A symbol is also shown: a hashmark means it’s a headed section and an ‘f’ means it’s a function definition. You can click this to jump to other sections.\n\n\n\nNavigating with headers in the R script pane.\n\n\n\n\nBackground jobs\nPerhaps an under-used pane is ‘Background jobs’. This is where you can run a separate R process that keeps your R console free. Go to Tools &gt; Background Jobs &gt; Start Background Job… to expose this tab if it isn’t already listed alongside the R console.\nWhy might you want to do this? As I write this post, there’s a background process to detect changes to the Quarto document that I’m writing and then update a preview I have running in the browser. You can do something similar for Shiny apps. You can continue to develop your app and test things in the console and the app preview will update on save. You won’t need to keep hitting the ‘Render’ or ‘Run app’ button every time you make a change."
