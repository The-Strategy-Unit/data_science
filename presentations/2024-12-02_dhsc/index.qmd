## Everything open, all the time

* Everything NHS-R does is open
  * (except Slack 🙁)
* Everything NHS-R produces has an open licence
* We teach the skills of open
  * Git, GitHub, how to write reusable code

## What does NHS-R do already?

* Training
* NHS-R academy

* Conference
* Webinars
* Slack
* Blogs
* GitHub and collaboration

## How can NHS-R help you?

* Training, and open training resources
* Online, (often instant) help
* Join the academy
* Community and belonging
* Hear about (and copy 😉) best practice
* Permission and visibility

## A couple of examples of NHS-R at its best

* NHSRplotthedots- in production across the NHS
* NHSRwaitinglists
* Intro to R and intermediate R
* Advent of code is a yearly event on the Slack- happening now 🎄

## Ask not what NHS-R can do for you…

* We need you!
  * Train analysts (intro, reporting, Shiny...)
  * Work on NHS-R solutions (like NHSRplotthedots)
  * Host and run webinars
  * Contribute to shared policy and practice documents
  * Give help to others
  * Blog

## Conclusion

* If you want to go fast, go alone
* If you want to go far, go together

  * Non demographic growth
  * "Mitigation"

## The work

* Rollout with NHP schemes
* Updating the model and interface in place
* Reporting on and analysing the model results and inputs

## Our interests

* Productionisation of models for healthcare
* Data science approaches to evidence review
* Data science approaches to text
