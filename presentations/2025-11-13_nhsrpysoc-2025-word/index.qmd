## Backstory 📖

* [NHP](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/) outputs reports: need automation/reproducibility
* [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) was the answer... until it wasn't!
* Solution: meet users where they are (Microsoft Word)
* Problem: how?

::: {.notes}
* We had what sounded like an obvious Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP).
* Ideal solution: create a Quarto document and populate it for a named organisation with images and calculations derived from data read from Azure.
* However, the customer's pre-existing Word template was complicated and was frequently being changed.
* It turned out to be easier to use the Word template as an input and insert our figures and values into it instead.
:::

## The Word template 📄

![](template.png){width='100%' fig-alt="A zoomed out view of pages of a complicated-looking Word document with many chunks of text, tables and page orientations. Much of the text is highlighted in green, yellow and blue."}

::: {.notes}
* This zoomed-out view of part of the Word document template highlights the complexity.
* The document uses a pre-existing theme; contains many specifically-formatted text chunks, tables and page orientations; and uses colour-coded highlighting to indicate who needs to edit which parts of the document.
* The document was being changed and updated quite a lot. The customers were used to amending Word documents quickly, as and when required.
* A more 'static' Quarto document wasn't going to cut the mustard here.
:::

## Process ✏️

1. Record a request with a [GitHub issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).
2. Tag model-run JSONs on Azure, update site-selections file.
3. Read SharePoint template with [{Microsoft365R}](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft365R).
4. Insert content with [{officer}](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/).
5. Write timestamped folder with doc, results, log.
6. Check output, return to recipient.

::: {.notes}
* How do we identify chosen runs? On Aure, with run_stage metadata on results files and a list of chosen sites.
* How to confirm with model relationship managers? Expose tagged scenarios and sites via a scheduled Quarto-report.
* Basic interface: supply a scheme code, at simplest level.
* Underlying functions save figures and values independently.
* Images inserted by moving the imaginary 'cursor' to a known string of text in the report.
* Value-insertion is more complicated: insert 'field' codes into the report, insert the values to custom document properties, refresh to insert these into the fields.
* The output is a timestamped directory with the report, standalone images and values, and a log.

## Generate a report 🖨️

In R:

```r
populate_template(
  scheme_code = "XYZ",                  # create a report for this scheme
  result_sets = get_nhp_result_sets(),  # fetch results metadata from Azure
  run_stages = list(                    # list the tagged model runs
    primary = "final_report_ndg2",      # main data source for the report
    secondary = "final_report_ndg1"     # used as a comparator
  )
)
```

Output file structure:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_scheme/
 ├──YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_scheme.log                        # log of printed metadata
 ├──YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_scheme_outputs-report_draft.docx  # populated report
 ├──figures/                                            # standalone PNG files
 └──values/                                             # CSVs of calculated values
    
``` 

::: {.notes}
* The interface for us is quite simple: a single function where we set the scheme code and identify the metadata 'tag' for the results that will form the main basis of the report and a secondary set used for comparative purposes.
* A bunch of sub-functions then read the data, calculate values, generate figures, read the Word template from SharePoint and then insert the content.
* The output is a timestamped folder that contains the populated Word doc, a subfolder of the charts and calculated values, and a log file that contains information printed to the console (details thigns like the scheme name and site selections for the run, as well as warning and error messages if present).

## Insert content with [{officer}](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/) 👮

For calculated values:

1. Add doc-property fields, e.g. { DOCPROPERTY item_01 }.
2. Add values to [custom doc properties](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/reference/set_doc_properties.html).
3. Update fields with corresponding property values.
 
For generated figures:

1. Add unique target strings, e.g. '[Insert Figure 8.2]'.
2. [Find](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/reference/cursor.html)/[replace](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/reference/body_add_img.html) with corresponding PNG. 

::: {.notes}
* The {officer} package is crucial for inserting our content into the template.
* We use different methods to insert values and images.
* For calculated values, first add document-property fields to the Word doc (ctrl+F9); then write your calculated values to the custom document properties with `officer::set_doc_properties()`; then open and refresh the document (F9) to replace the fields with the corresponding value for the named property.
* To insert images, programmatically find unique target strings with {officer}'s `cursor_reach()` and then overwrite with images using `body_add_img()`; we use  and a custom `insert_figure_on_cursor()` to do this.

## 'Doing it right' 💯

* [Github](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_final_reports): 'learn by doing', challenge and improve things
* Documentation/version history have [saved us](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_final_reports/pull/123)!
* The repo is a springboard for parallel/future work

## Reflections 🪞

* Challenge your thinking, be adaptable to user needs
* Embrace agility and acknowledge fragility
* 'The power of friendship' keeps things working

::: {.notes}
* The default mode of 'make a Quarto doc' wasn't the right fit here, but we recognised that and pivoted quickly.
* We know the solution isn't perfect, but it is good enough.
* The process has some frailties, but we recognise them. For example, the report path being changed on SharePoint means we can't retrieve it!
* Talking between us on the code side, but also with the user, is really important to handle changing needs and to keep the process and outputs fir for purpose.
