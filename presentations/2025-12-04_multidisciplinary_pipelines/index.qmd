## Intro

* This presentation is about building a model to predict the future
* Doing it well required high quality collaboration from a range of staff in different teams with very different skillsets
* I think the stuff "around" the modelling is non-obvious and this presentation is intended to help others treading a similar path

## Why?

* New Hospital Programme came to the Strategy Unit c.2020
* Predict demand for the future of the hospitals c.2041
* We built on existing work and knowledge in the SU as well as the literature
* I was not here!

## The principles

* Probabilistic
* [Transparent and open source](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/transforming-hospital-planning-open-source-demand-and-capacity-model)
* Collaborative
* Reproducible
* By the NHS, for the NHS
* [(And now award winning)](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/strategy-unit-demand-model-wins-prestigious-florence-nightingale-award)

## So what does it do?

## So what does it do?

* Demographic change
* Non-demographic change
* Types of potentially mitigable activity
* More to come

## The model

* Sample the parameters (assume normal)
* Calculate demand at IP, OP, A&E level
* Do this 256 times and plot the distribution
* The results are conceptually at row level, but not in practice

## Structure of the project

* Not going to show a big confusing diagram
* [There is one if you want one](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/components-overview.html)
* Three places that stuff happens, partly because of IG
* We store and process data in Azure (SQL -> databricks; Docker)
* We host the reports and dashboards separately, with no data on this server, only results
* And we have a plethora of scripts, notebooks, and other gubbins on laptops

## Versioning, RAP, and audit

* Versioning is really challenging
* We learned a lot!
* Are we Apple or Microsoft?
* RAP is important for audit too
* We continue to wrestle with versioning of data to support old model runs

## RAP is awesome... right?

## Challenges

* All models are wrong
* Consistency versus accuracy
* "It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future"
  * "This model is simple"

## The national elicitation exercise

* We asked experts to predict likely levels of mitigation in the future, in a structured way
* We also made some whizzy data science tools to do it with- which ended up being really important and useful
* It's not my area so I won't say any more- this was Prof Mohammed and team
* We show these values to trusts to help them make better guesses about the future

## Challenges- users

* Complexity correctness versus accessibility correctness
* Who is a user? What do they want? (I'll talk more about this in a talk later on)
* Hospital vs ICB vs NHP vs director vs data scientist vs... perspective

## Challenges- decision making

* Different analytical teams
  * Theoretical ideas to... 
  * Pragmatic interpretations 
  * All delivered with data science
* NHP
* Strategic versus operational
* Prioritising

## Challenges- openness and transparency

* The work it takes to actually make this happen
* Running the code
* IG and sharing

## The future

* National and regional model runs
* Bring your own data (FDP?)
* Understanding more about categories of potentially mitigable activity, who thinks what's possible, and why it matters
* Increasing understanding of the shift from hospital to the community
