## Intro

* For analysts, there is a culture of "I want to progress without being a manager"
* Many analysts don't want to and wouldn't enjoy being a manager- and they should progress without being one
* But many would, and I want to speak today to those who are thinking about being a manager, or already are

## My story

* The best lesson I ever learned
* Spent 15 years being a nerd and letting others lead
* I have never in my life had an analyst for a manager
* I feel into being a manager because I wanted to effect change at my previous employer

## The Downside

* I don't always understand everything that's happening
  * _Still_ don't know what databricks is üòÇ
* Some of the things I do are honestly kind of boring
* Some days I just ping between meetings all day and never catch myself up

## What the heck _do_ I do all day

* Product owner
* Team leader
* Line manager
* Member of the SU leadership group
* Head of data science
* Number one learning- be different people at different times

## Product owner

* We do kind of scrum
* I decide what's in and what's out
* Number one learning- stay out of the way (a familiar lesson from others)
* Love: clarity; building a product people actually want; giving the team purpose and shaping what we do
* Hate: I'm on the outside- don't always understand stuff

## Team leader

* Recruitment
* What do we do- where are we going
* Culture > Strategy (#recruitforvalues)

## Line manager

* The research says line managers are really important
* I ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è hearing about what my staff are doing and where they want to be in five years
* I want to live in a world where they are in charge, because they're all awesome
  * (remember #recruitforvalues)

## Member of the SU leadership group

## Head of data science

## Why I'm a terrible manager

* I'm introverted
* I'm disorganised
* I have an opinion about everything and can't keep my mouth shut
* I say what's on my mind; I can't help it

## Why I'm a good manager

* I'm introverted
* I'm disorganised
* I have an opinion about everything and can't keep my mouth shut
* I say what's on my mind; I can't help it

## "Strategy"

* Such a divisive word
* Honestly I think a lot of analysts think it's a bit dumb
* The strategisers are not talking the language of the strategisees

## The upside

* Pinging around hearing about different stuff is fun
* Shaping the team and its projects is fun
* Mostly for me this job is about making a difference
  * Recruiting is miserable- hiring great staff is wonderful
  * Faffing around with budgets is miserable- growing the team is wonderful
  * Sitting typing emails all day is meh- connecting people and projects is wonderful

## My learning to date

* Share credit with the team and take the blame for yourself
  * The team does everything is can reasonably do- and then it fails with pride
* Be honest, always
* Be positive
* Be consistent
* If you make a mistake, put it right

## It's a unique role

* Every day I wake up and don't help the team with the code for the sprint
* Every day I think about what I can bring to the team
