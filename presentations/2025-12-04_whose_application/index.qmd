## Introduction

* I want to tell a story
* It's about ending up in the middle of two things- data science and digital
* I naively launched in the wrong direction and have beeen redirecting since
* I'm not an expert in anything I talk about today- if you're doing something big ask an expert

## The story

* I lead a team that built a demand and capacity model for the New Hospital Programme
* It's a simulation model that predicts demand for acute care in c. 2041
* There's a huge amount of analytical work on and around the model
* We have produced lots of whizzy reports and dashboards to assist with parameter setting and results interpretation

## The problem

* We did everything we were supposed to and people were happy with the model
* But there were issues
* User feedback and prioritisation of developments were ad-hoc
* Programmes of work were siloed 
* Crucially, the needs of different bugfixes and improvements were considered in isolation
* The connection between different deliverables was poorly understood, leading to delays and missed opportunities

## Where next?

* I wanted somebody to work across all of the different streams of work
* They would consider the work programme as a whole and help to prioritise
* We started to think, **really think** of individuals interacting with our model, inside and outside the unit, as users

## Another story

* This is someone else's story

## The solution
