- Mention origins of this - used to be hosted by NHSE
- Emphasise that we facilitate - we're not there to answer questions but to encourage discussion
:::

## Who is it for?

- Open to anyone working in the NHS with an interest in RAP
- No coding experience required - managers welcome!
- Discussions [captured on GitHub](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/RAP_Drop_In/discussions) to share learning more widely

::: {.notes}

- Attendance: 10 attendees on average
- Background of attendees very varied - NHS England, CSUs, Trusts, Scientists, Analysts
- We also plan everything using GitHub

:::

## Common themes

- Lots of brilliant individual work happening across the NHS
- Organisational barriers are widespread
- Questions around upskilling
- How to deploy data science products, given limited infrastructure?
- Concerns around safety of data

Can we solve these problems once, for the community?

## Some wins

## The RAP Code Review Buddies Network

## What is the RAP Code Review Buddies Network?

Every 3 months, you will be randomly paired up with someone else in the network. 

As a pair, you will arrange to meet up online and talk through some code you have written. 

You can then ask each other questions about the code and offer constructive comments.

## Is the network for me?

We're suggesting a more relaxed approach to code review - a "code walkthrough". Guidance will be provided.

If you have written **any code in the past three months** for your role, in any language (such as SQL, R, or Python), then you have enough coding knowledge! 

People at all stages of their coding and RAP journey are very welcome.

## Sounds awesome, how do I sign up?
