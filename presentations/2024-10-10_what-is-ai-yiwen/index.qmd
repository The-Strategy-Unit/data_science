## AI could help identify high-risk heart patients^[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj620yl96kzo]

The University of Leeds has helped **train an AI system** called Optimise, that looked at **health records** of more than **two million people**.

...

Of those two million records that were scanned, more than **400,000 people** were identified as being high risk for the likes of heart failure, stroke and diabetes.


## How it works

- Health records are structured data - can be stored in a table / dataframe

[ Provide example here ]

[ Very briefly talk about the different types of models ]

[ Show some code for how to train a model? (it's not hugely complicated) ]

## Pros

- These models can be more easily explained - not a black box like LLMs
- Can surface patterns in the data that are not immediately obvious

## Cons

- The quality of the data determines the quality of the model

## Issues to look out for

Is the model being retrained?
