## Data science team repo

This repo is in very early development but we expect it to feature:

* Presentations the team have delivered
* A Quarto presentation theme that conforms to SU branding
* A website/ blog that the data science team can use to blog and compile other forms of resources

We may end up splitting off some of these elements to make them easier to deploy, we haven't quite thought it through yet. If stuff does move around we'll update the README

Please note this project uses renv. On Windows, I needed to install the R toolchain [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to compile some of the projects
